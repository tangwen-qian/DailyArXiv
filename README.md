| **[Fault Diagnosis across Heterogeneous Domains via Self-Adaptive Temporal-Spatial Attention and Sample Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11083v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have shown promising performance in fault diagnosis for multimode process. Most existing studies assume that the collected health state categories from different operating modes are identical. However, in real industrial scenarios, these categories typically exhibit only partial overlap. The incompleteness of the available data and the large distributional differences between the operating modes pose a significant challenge to existing fault diagnosis methods. To address this problem, a novel fault diagnosis model named self-adaptive temporal-spatial attention network (TSA-SAN) is proposed. First, inter-mode mappings are constructed using healthy category data to generate multimode samples. To enrich the diversity of the fault data, interpolation is performed between healthy and fault samples. Subsequently, the fault diagnosis model is trained using real and generated data. The self-adaptive instance normalization is established to suppress irrelevant information while retaining essential statistical features for diagnosis. In addition, a temporal-spatial attention mechanism is constructed to focus on the key features, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available on Github at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/TSA-SAN.</p></details> | 31 pages, 11 figures |

In addition to existence of solutions and their stability with respect to perturbations to the problem data, we show convergence of spatial discretizations. Our framework accommodates various standard low-rank tensor formats for multivariate functions, including tensor train and hierarchical tensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Light and Smart Wearable Platform with Multimodal Foundation Model for Enhanced Spatial Reasoning in People with Blindness and Low Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10875v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People with blindness and low vision (pBLV) face significant challenges, struggling to navigate environments and locate objects due to limited visual cues. Spatial reasoning is crucial for these individuals, as it enables them to understand and interpret the spatial relationships in their surroundings, enhancing their ability to navigate and interact more safely and independently. Current multi-modal large language (MLLM) models for low vision people lack the spatial reasoning capabilities needed to effectively assist in these tasks. Moreover, there is a notable absence of lightweight, easy-to-use systems that allow pBLV to effectively perceive and interact with their surrounding environment. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial enhanced multi-modal large language model based approach for visually impaired individuals. By fine-tuning the MLLM to incorporate spatial reasoning capabilities, our method significantly improves the understanding of environmental context, which is critical for navigation and object recognition. The innovation extends to a hardware component, designed as an attachment for glasses, ensuring increased accessibility and ease of use. This integration leverages advanced VLMs to interpret visual data and provide real-time, spatially aware feedback to the user. Our approach aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning models and practical, user-friendly assistive devices, offering a robust solution for visually impaired users to navigate their surroundings more effectively and independently. The paper includes an in-depth evaluation using the VizWiz dataset, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and user experience. Additionally, we design a comprehensive dataset to evaluate our method's effectiveness in realworld situations, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and user experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website and code: https://dktpt44.github.io/LV-GPT/</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Spatial Transcriptomics Interpolation via Cross-modal Cross-slice Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10729v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a promising technique that characterizes the spatial gene profiling patterns within the tissue context. Comprehensive ST analysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the missing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical feasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the first attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate positions between adjacent ST slices. Despite intuitive, effective ST interpolation presents significant challenges, including 1) limited continuity across heterogeneous tissue sections, 2) complex intrinsic correlation across genes, and 3) intricate cellular structures and biological semantics within each tissue section. To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a distance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture cross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices, 2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale biological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that integrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter and align the essential cellular features across ST and H\&E images. Extensive experiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST interpolation. Codes are available at https://github.com/XiaofeiWang2018/C2-STi.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[GeoGrid-Bench: Can Foundation Models Understand Multimodal Gridded Geo-Spatial Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10714v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GeoGrid-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of foundation models to understand geo-spatial data in the grid structure. Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16 climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial data analysis and used to support scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks for Human Action Recognition Over-Parameterized?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10679v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) showcase impressive performance in skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR). However, despite the development of numerous models, their recognition performance does not differ significantly after aligning the input settings. With this observation, we hypothesize that ST-GCNs are over-parameterized for HAR, a conjecture subsequently confirmed through experiments employing the lottery ticket hypothesis. Additionally, a novel sparse ST-GCNs generator is proposed, which trains a sparse architecture from a randomly initialized dense network while maintaining comparable performance levels to the dense components. Moreover, we generate multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs by integrating sparse structures at various sparsity levels and demonstrate that the assembled model yields a significant enhancement in HAR performance. Thorough experiments on four datasets, including NTU-RGB+D 60(120), Kinetics-400, and FineGYM, demonstrate that the proposed sparse ST-GCNs can achieve comparable performance to their dense components. Even with 95% fewer parameters, the sparse ST-GCNs exhibit a degradation of <1% in top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs, which require only 66% of the parameters of the dense ST-GCNs, demonstrate an improvement of >1% in top-1 accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/davelailai/Sparse-ST-GCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can On Body Sensing Be Spatial Adaptive?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10546v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable sensors are typically affixed to specific locations on the human body, and their position remains static, only changing unintentionally due to motion artifacts. This static configuration introduces significant limitations. As a result, current systems miss the opportunity to capture dynamic physiological data from diverse body regions. This research investigates the potential of developing movable sensors that adaptively reposition themselves to sample different areas of interest on the body, addressing gaps in spatial coverage. We designed, developed, and fabricated a 3 x 3 matrix platform to support moving sensors from one location to another. We validated the feasibility through simulations on a matrix of up to 9 x 9 locations with up to 16 concurrent sensors and real-world prototype characterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRAGE: A Multi-modal Benchmark for Spatial Perception, Reasoning, and Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10604v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial perception and reasoning are core components of human cognition, encompassing object recognition, spatial relational understanding, and dynamic reasoning. Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Selective Active Noise Control for Open-fitting Hearables with Acausal Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10372v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in active noise control have enabled the development of hearables with spatial selectivity, which actively suppress undesired noise while preserving desired sound from specific directions. In this work, we propose an improved approach to spatially selective active noise control that incorporates acausal relative impulse responses into the optimization process, resulting in significantly improved performance over the causal design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables with spatially localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment. Performance is evaluated in terms of speech distortion, noise reduction, and signal-to-noise ratio improvement across different delays and degrees of acausality. Results show that the proposed acausal optimization consistently outperforms the causal approach across all metrics and scenarios, as acausal filters more effectively characterize the response of the desired source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forum...</summary><p>Forum Acusticum/Euronoise 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Robot Task Allocation for Homogeneous Tasks with Collision Avoidance via Spatial Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10073v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against 17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Scheduled for presentation at an upcoming conference</p></details> |
| **[VGC-RIO: A Tightly Integrated Radar-Inertial Odometry with Spatial Weighted Doppler Velocity and Local Geometric Constrained RCS Histograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09103v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 4D radar-inertial odometry have demonstrated promising potential for autonomous lo calization in adverse conditions. However, effective handling of sparse and noisy radar measurements remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a radar-inertial odometry with a spatial weighting method that adapts to unevenly distributed points and a novel point-description histogram for challenging point registration. To make full use of the Doppler velocity from different spatial sections, we propose a weighting calculation model. To enhance the point cloud registration performance under challenging scenarios, we con struct a novel point histogram descriptor that combines local geometric features and radar cross-section (RCS) features. We have also conducted extensive experiments on both public and self-constructed datasets. The results demonstrate the precision and robustness of the proposed VGC-RIO.</p></details> |  |
| **[LatticeVision: Image to Image Networks for Modeling Non-Stationary Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09803v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field') but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers, and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields. However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus, many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image (I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural models for prediction of spatially patterned phase transitions: methods and challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09718v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models' capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecSphere: Dual-Pass Spectral-Spatial Graph Neural Networks with Certified Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08320v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SpecSphere, the first dual-pass spectral-spatial GNN that certifies every prediction against both $\ell\_{0}$ edge flips and $\ell\_{\infty}$ feature perturbations, adapts to the full homophily-heterophily spectrum, and surpasses the expressive power of 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman while retaining linear-time complexity. Our model couples a Chebyshev-polynomial spectral branch with an attention-gated spatial branch and fuses their representations through a lightweight MLP trained in a cooperative-adversarial min-max game. We further establish (i) a uniform Chebyshev approximation theorem, (ii) minimax-optimal risk across the homophily-heterophily spectrum, (iii) closed-form robustness certificates, and (iv) universal approximation strictly beyond 1-WL. SpecSphere achieves state-of-the-art node-classification accuracy and delivers tighter certified robustness guarantees on real-world benchmarks. These results demonstrate that high expressivity, heterophily adaptation, and provable robustness can coexist within a single, scalable architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial public goods games with queueing and reputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09154v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world social and economic systems, the provisioning of public goods generally entails continuous interactions among individuals, with decisions to cooperate or defect being influenced by dynamic factors such as timing, resource availability, and the duration of engagement. However, the traditional public goods game ignores the asynchrony of the strategy adopted by players in the game. To address this problem, we propose a spatial public goods game that integrates an M/M/1 queueing system to simulate the dynamic flow of player interactions. We use a birth-death process to characterize the stochastic dynamics of this queueing system, with players arriving following a Poisson process and service times being exponentially distributed under a first-come-first-served basis with finite queue capacity. We also incorporate reputation so that players who have cooperated in the past are more likely to be chosen for future interactions. Our research shows that a high arrival rate, low service rate, and the reputation mechanism jointly facilitate the emergence of cooperative individuals in the network, which thus provides an interesting and new perspective for the provisioning of public goods.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Quality Spatial Reconstruction and Orthoimage Generation Using Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19703v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Highly accurate geometric precision and dense image features characterize True Digital Orthophoto Maps (TDOMs), which are in great demand for applications such as urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental monitoring.Traditional TDOM generation methods need sophisticated processes, such as Digital Surface Models (DSM) and occlusion detection, which are computationally expensive and prone to errors.This work presents an alternative technique rooted in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), free of explicit DSM and occlusion detection. With depth map generation, spatial information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost, which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain modeling. This approach provides accurate spatial data, which assists users in better planning and decision-making based on maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coordinated Spatial Reuse Scheduling With Machine Learning in IEEE 802.11 MAPC Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07278v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The densification of Wi-Fi deployments means that fully distributed random channel access is no longer sufficient for high and predictable performance. Therefore, the upcoming IEEE 802.11bn amendment introduces multi-access point coordination (MAPC) methods. This paper addresses a variant of MAPC called coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR), where devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel, with the power adjusted to minimize interference. The C-SR scheduling problem is selecting which devices transmit concurrently and with what settings. We provide a theoretical upper bound model, optimized for either throughput or fairness, which finds the best possible transmission schedule using mixed-integer linear programming. Then, a practical, probing-based approach is proposed which uses multi-armed bandits (MABs), a type of reinforcement learning, to solve the C-SR scheduling problem. We validate both classical (flat) MAB and hierarchical MAB (H-MAB) schemes with simulations and in a testbed. Using H-MABs for C-SR improves aggregate throughput over legacy IEEE 802.11 (on average by 80\% in random scenarios), without reducing the number of transmission opportunities per station. Finally, our framework is lightweight and ready for implementation in Wi-Fi devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Spatial Health Disparities Using Disease Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02086v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epidemiologists commonly use regional aggregates of health outcomes to map mortality or incidence rates and identify geographic disparities. However, to detect health disparities across regions, it is necessary to identify "difference boundaries" that separate neighboring regions with significantly different spatial effects. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with multiple outcomes for each unit and accounting for dependence among diseases and across areal units. In this study, we address the issue of multivariate difference boundary detection for correlated diseases by formulating the problem in terms of Bayesian pairwise multiple comparisons by extending it through the introduction of adjacency modeling and disease graph dependencies. Specifically, we seek the posterior probabilities of neighboring spatial effects being different. To accomplish this, we adopt a class of multivariate areally referenced Dirichlet process models that accommodate spatial and interdisease dependence by endowing the spatial random effects with a discrete probability law. Our method is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to detect difference boundaries for multiple cancers using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geography of Transportation Cybersecurity: Visitor Flows, Industry Clusters, and Spatial Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08822v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem, encompassing cybersecurity, automotive, and transportation and logistics sectors, will lead to the formation of distinct spatial clusters and visitor flow patterns across the US. This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of visitor flows, analyzing how socioeconomic factors shape industry clustering and workforce distribution within these evolving sectors. To model and predict visitor flow patterns, we develop a BiTransGCN framework, integrating an attention-based Transformer architecture with a Graph Convolutional Network backbone. By integrating AI-enabled forecasting techniques with spatial analysis, this study improves our ability to track, interpret, and anticipate changes in industry clustering and mobility trends, thereby supporting strategic planning for a secure and resilient transportation network. It offers a data-driven foundation for economic planning, workforce development, and targeted investments in the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Bayesian non-parametric spatial modeling for cross-sample identification of spatially variable genes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09654v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized tissue analysis by simultaneously mapping gene expression, spatial topography, and histological context across consecutive tissue sections, enabling systematic investigation of spatial heterogeneity. The detection of spatially variable (SV) genes, which are molecular signatures with position-dependent expression, provides critical insights into disease mechanisms spanning oncology, neurology, and cardiovascular research. Current methodologies, however, confront dual constraints: predominant reliance on predefined spatial pattern templates restricts detection of novel complex spatial architectures, and inconsistent sample selection strategies compromise analytical stability and biological interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework incorporating non-parametric spatial modeling and across-sample integration. It takes advantage of the non-parametric technique and develops an adaptive spatial process accommodating complex pattern discovery while maintaining biological interpretability. A novel cross-sample bi-level shrinkage prior is further introduced for robust multi-sample SV gene detection, facilitating more effective information fusion. An efficient variational inference is developed for posterior inference ensuring computational scalability. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed method over existing analytical frameworks, and its application to DLPFC data reveals interpretable SV genes whose spatial patterns delineate neuroanatomically relevant clusters and gradients, advancing brain transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient 3D Perception on Multi-Sweep Point Cloud with Gumbel Spatial Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07742v4)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies point cloud perception within outdoor environments. Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive point cloud sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of point cloud sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of point cloud sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves several 3D perception baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Confounding in Multivariate Areal Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07232v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate spatial confounding in the presence of multivariate disease dependence. In the "analysis model perspective" of spatial confounding, adding a spatially dependent random effect can lead to significant variance inflation of the posterior distribution of the fixed effects. The "data generation perspective" views covariates as stochastic and correlated with an unobserved spatial confounder, leading to inferior statistical inference over multiple realizations. While multiple methods have been proposed for adjusting statistical models to mitigate spatial confounding in estimating regression coefficients, results on interactions between spatial confounding and multivariate dependence are very limited. We contribute to this domain by investigating spatial confounding from the analysis and data generation perspectives in a Bayesian coregionalized areal regression model. We derive novel results that distinguish variance inflation due to spatial confounding from inflation based on multicollinearity between predictors and provide insights into the estimation efficiency of a spatial estimator under a spatially confounded data generation model. We demonstrate favorable performance of spatial analysis compared to a non-spatial model in our simulation experiments even in the presence of spatial confounding and a misspecified spatial structure. In this regard, we align with several other authors in the defense of traditional hierarchical spatial models (Gilbert et al., 2025; Khan and Berrett, 2023; Zimmerman and Ver Hoef, 2022) and extend this defense to multivariate areal models. We analyze county-level data from the US on obesity / diabetes prevalence and diabetes-related cancer mortality, comparing the results with and without spatial random effects.</p></details> | 26 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The demo page is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Price Equilibria in a Spatial Competition with Captive Buyers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06961v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores price competition with exogenous product differentiation in a spatial model similar to that of Nakagawa (2023). Nakagawa examines product differentiation within the framework of Varian (1980). Nakagawa integrates Varian's concept of uninformed consumers, who lack complete price information, into a spatial model based on Hotelling (1929). While Nakagawa placed informed consumers at the center of the Hotelling line and used quadratic transportation costs, our study employs a uniform distribution of informed consumers and linear transportation costs. This approach enables a more direct comparison with established spatial competition literature, particularly Osborne and Pitchik (1987). We classify equilibrium candidates and characterize the parameter regions corresponding to each equilibrium. There is no pure equilibrium in the region where we construct mixed strategy equilibria. Furthermore, we compare the expected profit in the equilibrium of our model with the findings of Osborne and Pitchik (1987).

Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision necessary for accuracy</p></details> |

One salient feature of the model is the incorporation of multiple spatial weight matrices through their linear combinations with varying coefficients, which help solve the problem of choosing the most ``correct'' one for applied econometricians who often face the availability of multiple expert spatial weight matrices. We estimate and make inferences on the model coefficients and coefficients in basis expansions of the varying coefficients through penalized estimations, establishing the oracle properties of the estimators and the consistency of the overall estimated spatial weight matrix, which can be time-dependent. We further consider two applications of our model in change point detections in dynamic spatial autoregressive models, providing theoretical justifications in consistent change point locations estimation and practical implementations. Simulation experiments demonstrate the performance of our proposed methodology, and real data analyses are also carried out.</p></details> | 58 pages, 7 figure |

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

Although there have been many successful marketplaces for data trading, the existing data marketplaces lack consideration of the case where buyers want to acquire a collection of datasets (instead of one), and the overall spatial coverage and connectivity matter. In this paper, we take the first attempt to formulate this problem as Budgeted Maximum Coverage with Connectivity Constraint (BMCC), which aims to acquire a dataset collection with the maximum spatial coverage under a limited budget while maintaining spatial connectivity. To solve the problem, we propose two approximate algorithms with detailed theoretical guarantees and time complexity analysis, followed by two acceleration strategies to further improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

Spatial thinning is a widely used preprocessing step in species distribution modeling (SDM) that can help reduce sampling bias, but existing R implementations rely on brute-force algorithms that scale poorly with large datasets. GeoThinneR implements multiple thinning approaches, including ensuring a minimum distance between points, subsampling points on a grid, and filtering based on decimal precision. To handle large datasets, it introduces two optimized algorithms based on local kd-trees and adaptive neighbor estimation, which greatly reduce memory usage and execution time. Additional functionalities such as group-wise thinning and point prioritization are included to facilitate its use in SDM workflows. We here provide performance benchmarks using both simulated and real-world data to demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Satellite Object Localization with Dilated Convolutions and Attention-aided Spatial Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05599v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research, we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW), mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach.

We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> |  |

These temporal-only NVCs fail to handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts. Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution bitstream. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/EsakaK/SEVC.</p></details> | 15 pages,CVPR |

However, smaller municipalities often face data limitations that hinder tailored climate strategies. This study generates detailed final energy consumption and emissions data at the local administrative level for Germany and Spain.

A key innovation is the application of XGBoost for imputing missing data, combined with a stepwise spatial disaggregation process incorporating district- and province-level statistics. Prioritizing reproducibility, our open-data approach provides a scalable framework for municipalities to develop actionable climate plans.

This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.

The primary goal in DLP is for agents to reach a consensus on a unified coordinate system that accurately reflects the relative positions of all points, $p_0, ..., p_{n-1}$. Extensive research on DLP has primarily focused on the feasibility and complexity of achieving consensus when agents have limited access to inter-agent distances, often due to missing or imprecise data. In this paper, however, we examine a minimalist, computationally efficient model of distributed computing in which agents have access to all pairwise distances, if needed. Specifically, we introduce a novel variant of population protocols, referred to as the spatial population protocols model. In this variant each agent can memorise one or a fixed number of coordinates, and when agents $a_i$ and $a_j$ interact, they can not only exchange their current knowledge but also either determine the distance $d(i,j)$ between them in $S$ (distance query model) or obtain the vector $v(i,j)$ spanning points $p_i$ and $p_j$ (vector query model). We propose several localisation protocols, including: (1) Two leader-based protocols with distance queries, stabilizing silently in $o(n)$ time using an efficient multi-contact epidemic, a generalization of the one-way epidemic in population protocols; (2) A distance-based protocol self-stabilizing silently in $O(n(\log n/n)^{1/(k+1)}\log n)$ time in $k$-dimensions, leveraging a leader election mechanism; (3) An optimally fast protocol with vector queries, self-stabilizing silently in $O(\log n)$ time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a brief announcement for SAND 2025</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity, Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable alternative to conventional approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Leveraging neural text-to-speech synthesis with FastSpeech 2 and VALL-E for expressive narration and character-specific voices, the framework employs advanced language models to automatically interpret textual narratives and generate realistic spatial audio effects. These sound effects are dynamically synchronized with the storyline through sophisticated temporal integration methods, including Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Diffusion-based generative models combined with higher-order ambisonics (HOA) and scattering delay networks (SDN) enable highly realistic 3D soundscapes, substantially enhancing listener immersion and narrative realism. This technology significantly advances audiobook applications, providing richer experiences for educational content, storytelling platforms, and accessibility solutions for visually impaired audiences. Future work will address personalization, ethical management of synthesized voices, and integration with multi-sensory platforms.</p></details> |  |

While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | Preprint |

A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, Proximal Policy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer (PPO-ACT), is proposed to model agent strategy optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional evolutionary game models frequently exhibit limitations in modeling long-term decision-making processes. Deep reinforcement learning effectively addresses this limitation by bridging policy gradient methods with evolutionary game theory. Our study pioneers the application of proximal policy optimization's continuous strategy optimization capability to public goods games through a two-stage adversarial curriculum transfer training paradigm. The experimental results show that PPO-ACT performs better in critical enhancement factor regimes. Compared to conventional standard proximal policy optimization methods, Q-learning and Fermi update rules, achieve earlier cooperation phase transitions and maintain stable cooperative equilibria. This framework exhibits better robustness when handling challenging scenarios like all-defector initial conditions. Systematic comparisons reveal the unique advantage of policy gradient methods in population-scale cooperation, i.e., achieving spatiotemporal payoff coordination through value function propagation. Our work provides a new computational framework for studying cooperation emergence in complex systems, algorithmically validating the punishment promotes cooperation hypothesis while offering methodological insights for multi-agent system strategy design.</p></details> |  |

In a multi-user multi-server MEC network, the mobility of terminals causes computing requests to be dynamically distributed in space. At the same time, the non-negligible dependencies among tasks in some specific applications impose temporal correlation constraints on the solution as well, leading the time-adjacent tasks to experience varying resource availability and competition from parallel counterparts. To address such dynamic spatial-temporal characteristics as a challenge in the allocation of communication and computation resources, we formulate a long-term delay-energy trade-off cost minimization problem in the view of jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. We begin by designing a priority evaluation scheme to decouple task dependencies and then develop a grouped Knapsack problem for channel allocation considering the current data load and channel status. Afterward, in order to meet the rapid response needs of MEC systems, we exploit the double duel deep Q network (D3QN) to make offloading decisions and integrate channel allocation results into the reward as part of the dynamic environment feedback in D3QN, constituting the joint optimization of task offloading and channel allocation. Finally, comprehensive simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the delay-energy trade-off cost and its adaptability for various applications.</p></details> |  |

The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can enhance both the spatial density and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms under varying degradations, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis.

The significant gap between 3D and language modalities makes it a notable challenge to distinguish multiple similar objects through the described spatial relationships. Current methods attempt to achieve cross-modal understanding in complex scenes via a target-centered learning mechanism, ignoring the perception of referred objects. We propose a novel 2D-assisted 3D visual grounding framework that constructs semantic-spatial scene graphs with referred object discrimination for relationship perception. The framework incorporates a dual-branch visual encoder that utilizes 2D pre-trained attributes to guide the multi-modal object encoding. Furthermore, our cross-modal interaction module uses graph attention to facilitate relationship-oriented information fusion. The enhanced object representation and iterative relational learning enable the model to establish effective alignment between 3D vision and referential descriptions. Experimental results on the popular benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in addressing the challenges of multiple similar distractors.</p></details> |  |

However, THz signal propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE conferences</p></details> |

Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

However, existing systems such as Simba and Sedona, which incorporate distributed spatial indexing, still incur substantial index construction overheads, rendering them far from optimal for real-time analytics. Recent studies demonstrate that learned indices can achieve high efficiency through well-designed machine learning models, but how to design a learned index for distributed spatial analytics remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present LiLIS, a Lightweight Distributed Learned Index for big spatial data. LiLIS combines machine-learned search strategies with spatial-aware partitioning within a distributed framework, and efficiently implements common spatial queries, including point query, range query, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and spatial joins. Extensive experimental results over real-world and synthetic datasets show that LiLIS outperforms state-of-the-art big spatial data analytics by $2-3$ orders of magnitude for most spatial queries, and the index building achieves $1.5-2\times$ speed-up.

However, the scarcity of labeled HSI data limits the full potential of deep learning, especially for transformer-based architectures that require large-scale training. To address this constraint, we propose Spatial-Frequency Masked Image Modeling (SFMIM), a self-supervised pretraining strategy for hyperspectral data that utilizes the large portion of unlabeled data. Our method introduces a novel dual-domain masking mechanism that operates in both spatial and frequency domains. The input HSI cube is initially divided into non-overlapping patches along the spatial dimension, with each patch comprising the entire spectrum of its corresponding spatial location. In spatial masking, we randomly mask selected patches and train the model to reconstruct the masked inputs using the visible patches. Concurrently, in frequency masking, we remove portions of the frequency components of the input spectra and predict the missing frequencies. By learning to reconstruct these masked components, the transformer-based encoder captures higher-order spectral-spatial correlations. We evaluate our approach on three publicly available HSI classification benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our model shows rapid convergence during fine-tuning, highlighting the efficiency of our pretraining strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear in IEEE IGARSS 2025</p></details> |

Recent computational advancements allow efficient, relatively simple, and quick approximate Bayesian estimation for MRP. As population health outcomes of interest including vaccination uptake are known to have spatial structure, precision may be gained by including space in the model. We test a recently proposed spatial MRP method that includes a BYM2 spatial term that smooths across demographics and geographic areas using a large, unrepresentative survey. We produce California county-level estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccination up to June 2021 using classic and spatial MRP models, and poststratify using data from the American Community Survey (US Census Bureau). We assess validity using reported first-dose vaccination counts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Neither classic nor spatial MRP models performed well, highlighting: 1. spatial MRP may be most appropriate for richer data contexts, 2. some demographics in the survey data are over-sampled and -aggregated, producing model over-smoothing, and 3. a need for survey producers to share user-representative metrics to better benchmark estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages (13 main article + 23 pages of appendix), 4 figures.

| **[Modeling Spatial Extremes using Non-Gaussian Spatial Autoregressive Models via Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03034v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data derived from remote sensing or numerical simulations often have a regular gridded structure and are large in volume, making it challenging to find accurate spatial models that can fill in missing grid cells or simulate the process effectively, especially in the presence of spatial heterogeneity and heavy-tailed marginal distributions. To overcome this issue, we present a spatial autoregressive modeling framework, which maps observations at a location and its neighbors to independent random variables. This is a highly flexible modeling approach and well-suited for non-Gaussian fields, providing simpler interpretability. In particular, we consider the SAR model with Generalized Extreme Value distribution innovations to combine the observation at a central grid location with its neighbors, capturing extreme spatial behavior based on the heavy-tailed innovations. While these models are fast to simulate by exploiting the sparsity of the key matrices in the computations, the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is prohibitive due to the intractability of the likelihood, making optimization challenging. To overcome this, we train a convolutional neural network on a large training set that covers a useful parameter space, and then use the trained network for fast parameter estimation. Finally, we apply this model to analyze annual maximum precipitation data from ERA-Interim-driven Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations, allowing us to explore its spatial extreme behavior across North America.</p></details> |  |
| **[Completing Spatial Transcriptomics Data for Gene Expression Prediction Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02980v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics is a groundbreaking technology that integrates histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on Spatial Transcriptomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.13027</p></details> |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02271v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Generative Artificial Ingelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models, presents transformative opportunities for urban applications through Urban Foundation Models. However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unaligned RGB Guided Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Spatial-Spectral Concordance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02109v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images super-resolution aims to improve the spatial resolution, yet its performance is often limited at high-resolution ratios. The recent adoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by the poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a favorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize information from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and its inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution (SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the issues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous approaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images more accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a Two-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image alignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more accurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged textures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and fusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we propose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the feature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature Aggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture aggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively generating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise attention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra interactions. Extensive experiments on three natural or remote-sensing datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonparametric Monitoring of Spatial Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17022v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In process monitoring, it is common for measurements to be taken regularly or randomly from different spatial locations in two or three dimensions. While there are nonparametric methods for process monitoring with such spatial data to detect changes in the mean, there is a gap in the literature for nonparametric control charting methods developed to monitor spatial dependence. This study considers streams of regular, rectangular data sets using spatial ordinal patterns (SOPs) as a nonparametric method to detect spatial dependencies. We propose novel SOP control charts, which are distribution-free and do not require prior Phase-I analysis. To uncover higher-order dependencies, we develop a new class of statistics that combines SOPs with the Box-Pierce approach. An extensive simulation study demonstrates the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed charts over traditional parametric approaches, particularly when the spatial dependence is nonlinear or bilateral or when the spatial data contains outliers. The proposed SOP control charts are illustrated using real-world datasets to detect (i) heavy rainfall in Germany, (ii) war-related fires in (eastern) Ukraine, and (iii) manufacturing defects in textile production. This wide range of applications and findings demonstrates the broad utility of the proposed nonparametric control charts. In addition, all methods in this study are provided as a publicly available \texttt{Julia} package on \href{https://github.com/AdaemmerP/OrdinalPatterns.jl}{GitHub} for further implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of Thermal Control Based on Spatial Thermal Comfort with Reconstructed Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00468v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving thermal comfort while maintaining energy efficiency is a critical objective in building system control. Conventional thermal comfort models, such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal variables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to capture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific comfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV estimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In addition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the thermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor measurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data, spatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions are then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control indoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental results show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error below 3\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26 scale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction outcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings underscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that incorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights for future occupant-centric building operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01917v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeInsert: Disentangled Text-Guided Object Insertion in 3D Gaussian Scene without Spatial Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01322v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.</p></details> |  |

The low rank component coefficients are endowed with a flexible graphical Gaussian Markov random field model. The utilization of a low rank and compactly-supported covariance structure combines the full-scale approximation and the basis graphical lasso; we term this new approach the full-scale basis graphical lasso (FSBGL). Estimation employs a graphical lasso-penalized likelihood, which is optimized using a difference-of-convex scheme. We illustrate the proposed approach with a challenging high-resolution simulation dataset of the thermosphere. In a comparison against state-of-the-art spatial models, the FSBGL performs better at capturing salient features of the thermospheric temperature fields, even with limited available training data.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 12 pages, methods, model and 4 figures of results</p></details> |

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times. Code is available at:https://github.com/fchest/ListenNet.</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

We present a 4D spatio-temporal metric-semantic mapping system that integrates multi-session measurements to track fruit growth over time. Our approach combines a LiDAR-RGB fusion module for 3D fruit localization with a 4D fruit association method leveraging positional, visual, and topology information for improved data association precision. Evaluated on real orchard data, our method achieves a 96.9% fruit counting accuracy for 1,790 apples across 60 trees, a mean fruit size estimation error of 1.1 cm, and a 23.7% improvement in 4D data association precision over baselines. We publicly release a multimodal dataset covering five fruit species across their growth seasons at https://4d-metric-semantic-mapping.org/</p></details> |  |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal data fusion of censored threshold exceedances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20268v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion models are widely used in air quality monitoring to integrate in situ and remote-sensing data, offering spatially complete and temporally detailed estimates. However, traditional Gaussian-based models often underestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To address this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted in extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution to jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving the temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and predict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London region by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis product from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ observation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by the UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for parameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based alternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold exceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in improved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the remote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and spatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which are not evident in remote-sensing data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DPyranet Features Fusion for Spatio-temporal Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18977v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented in the Undergraduate Conference on Intelligent Computing and Systems (UCICS 2025) organised by Varendra University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty.

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents, behave differently in the real-world. We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

| **[Decoding Covert Speech from EEG Using a Functional Areas Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03762v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covert speech involves imagining speaking without audible sound or any movements. Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG. The code for this work has been made public at https://github.com/Jiang-Muyun/FAST</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[AttentiveGRU: Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Advanced Radar-Based BEV Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00559v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bird's-eye view (BEV) object detection has become important for advanced automotive 3D radar-based perception systems. However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Spatio-Temporal Information Processing in Spiking Neural Networks via Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neurons and Hybrid Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12407v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) exhibit higher energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) due to their unique spike-driven mechanism. Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops.

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |

Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to Accelerate Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15927v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |
| **[STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

| **[Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT) for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach processes multi-station waveform data and generates station-specific detection probabilities. Experiments show superior performance over a conventional GCN baseline in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), highlighting its potential for robust multi-station earthquake detection.

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation. The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode informative thinking without the information loss associated with autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency. Source code is available at https://github.com/xuyige/SoftCoT.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, most existing methods rely on fixed time step sizes during rollout, which limits their ability to adapt to varying temporal complexity and often leads to error accumulation. To address this gap, we propose the Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion (TANTE), a novel operator-learning framework that produces continuous-time predictions with adaptive step sizes. TANTE predicts future states by performing a Taylor expansion at the current state, where neural networks learn both the higher-order temporal derivatives and the local radius of convergence. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its rollout based on the local behavior of the solution, thereby reducing cumulative error and improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TANTE across a wide range of PDE benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to fixed-step baselines, delivering accuracy gains of 10-50 % and speed-ups of 30-80 % at inference.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

We aim for an affirmative answer by proposing two novel test-time fine-tuning methods to improve uncertain model predictions. Instead of greedily selecting the most likely class, we introduce an additional step, \emph{focus on the likely classes}, to refine predictions. By applying a theoretically motivated single gradient descent step with a large learning rate, we refine predictions when an initial forward pass indicates high uncertainty. This aligns predictions more closely with the ideal of assigning zero probability to less plausible outcomes. The experimental evaluation demonstrates accuracy gains for one of our methods, which emphasizes shared features among likely classes, across diverse text and image domain models. %Our theoretical discussion provides a deeper understanding, highlighting the varying impact of shared and non-shared features among (focus) classes. %Our discussion also suggests an interesting view on standard, offline training vs. test-time training: Opposing optimization rationales regarding breadth of feature dependence are preferable during each training phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-TTA: A Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation Framework for Visual Search in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11350v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform autonomous visual search for environmental monitoring, a robot may leverage satellite imagery as a prior map. This can help inform coarse, high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow fine-grained, explicit visual recognition of targets. However, there are some challenges to overcome with using satellite images to direct visual search. For one, targets that are unseen in satellite images are underrepresented (compared to ground images) in most existing datasets, and thus vision models trained on these datasets fail to reason effectively based on indirect visual cues. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework that can accept text and/or image input. First, we pretrain a remote sensing image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, gradient updates (weighted by uncertainty) are used to correct (potentially inaccurate) predictions and improve search performance. To validate Search-TTA's performance, we curate a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data. We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 9.7%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions. It also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art VLMs. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.</p></details> |  |

However, real-time interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings -- $\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation (TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present $\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$, a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a strong baseline, yet overall performance remains modest -- highlighting the difficulty of TGLG and motivating further research in real-time VLMs. Code and data available $\href{https://github.com/yukw777/tglg}{here}$.</p></details> | 18 pages |

The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network (MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions, resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.</p></details> |  |

It optimises the effect parameters to minimise the distance between the style embeddings of the processed audio and the reference. However, this method treats all possible configurations equally and relies solely on the embedding space, which can lead to unrealistic or biased results. We address this pitfall by introducing a Gaussian prior derived from a vocal preset dataset, DiffVox, over the parameter space. The resulting optimisation is equivalent to maximum-a-posteriori estimation. Evaluations on vocal effects transfer on the MedleyDB dataset show significant improvements across metrics compared to baselines, including a blind audio effects estimator, nearest-neighbour approaches, and uncalibrated ST-ITO. The proposed calibration reduces parameter mean squared error by up to 33% and matches the reference style better. Subjective evaluations with 16 participants confirm our method's superiority, especially in limited data regimes. This work demonstrates how incorporating prior knowledge in inference time enhances audio effects transfer, paving the way for more effective and realistic audio processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WASPAA 2025</p></details> |

First, we introduce the Diffusion Model for Residual Regression (DMRR) framework, which unifies diffusion-based probabilistic regression methods. Within this framework, FALDA leverages Fourier-based decomposition to incorporate a component-specific architecture, enabling tailored modeling of individual temporal components. A conditional diffusion model is utilized to estimate the future noise term, while our proposed lightweight denoiser, DEMA (Decomposition MLP with AdaLN), conditions on the historical noise term to enhance denoising performance. Through mathematical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that FALDA effectively reduces epistemic uncertainty, allowing probabilistic learning to primarily focus on aleatoric uncertainty. Experiments on six real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FALDA consistently outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting approaches across most datasets for long-term time series forecasting while achieving enhanced computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Notably, FALDA also achieves superior overall performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point forecasting approaches, with improvements of up to 9%.</p></details> |  |

Due to their unique data representation choice of using spikes and spike trains, they mostly rely on additions and thresholding operations to achieve results approaching state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This advantage is hindered by the fact that their temporal characteristic does not map well to already existing accelerator hardware like GPUs. Therefore, this work will introduce a hardware accelerator architecture capable of computing feedforward LIF-only SNNs, as well as an accompanying encoding method to efficiently encode already existing data into spike trains. Together, this leads to a design capable of >99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, with ~0.29ms inference times on a Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA, as well as ~0.17ms on a custom ASIC using the open-source predictive 7nm ASAP7 PDK. Furthermore, this work will showcase the advantages of the previously presented differential time encoding for spikes, as well as provide proof that merging spikes from different synapses given in differential time encoding can be done efficiently in hardware.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches attempt to capture these latent effects via handcrafted summary features. We propose a Set-Sequence model that eliminates the need for handcrafted features. The Set model first learns a shared cross-sectional summary at each period. The Sequence model then ingests the summary-augmented time series for each unit independently to predict its outcome. Both components are learned jointly over arbitrary sets sampled during training. Our approach harnesses the set nature of the cross-section and is computationally efficient, generating set summaries in linear time relative to the number of units. It is also flexible, allowing the use of existing sequence models and accommodating a variable number of units at inference.

| **[When Mitigations Backfire: Timing Channel Attacks and Defense for PRAC-Based RowHammer Mitigations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10111v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) has emerged as a robust framework for mitigating RowHammer (RH) vulnerabilities in modern DRAM systems. However, we uncover a critical vulnerability: a timing channel introduced by the Alert Back-Off (ABO) protocol and Refresh Management (RFM) commands. We present PRACLeak, a novel attack that exploits these timing differences to leak sensitive information, such as secret keys from vulnerable AES implementations, by monitoring memory access latencies. To counter this, we propose Timing-Safe PRAC (TPRAC), a defense that eliminates PRAC-induced timing channels without compromising RH mitigation efficacy. TPRAC uses Timing-Based RFMs, issued periodically and independent of memory activity. It requires only a single-entry in-DRAM mitigation queue per DRAM bank and is compatible with existing DRAM standards. Our evaluations demonstrate that TPRAC closes timing channels while incurring only 3.4% performance overhead at the RH threshold of 1024.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was originally submitted to ISCA 2025 (https://iscaconf.org/isca2025/) on November 22, 2024, accepted on March 21, 2025, and will be presented on June 24, 2025.

| **[A Multi-scale Representation Learning Framework for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08199v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information, the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Enhanced YOLOv8 Model for Real-Time and Accurate Pothole Detection and Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04207v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Potholes cause vehicle damage and traffic accidents, creating serious safety and economic problems. Therefore, early and accurate detection of potholes is crucial. Existing detection methods are usually only based on 2D RGB images and cannot accurately analyze the physical characteristics of potholes. In this paper, a publicly available dataset of RGB-D images (PothRGBD) is created and an improved YOLOv8-based model is proposed for both pothole detection and pothole physical features analysis. The Intel RealSense D415 depth camera was used to collect RGB and depth data from the road surfaces, resulting in a PothRGBD dataset of 1000 images. The data was labeled in YOLO format suitable for segmentation. A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg architecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure more accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps with high accuracy. The standard YOLOv8n-seg model achieved 91.9% precision, 85.2% recall and 91.9% mAP@50. With the proposed model, the values increased to 93.7%, 90.4% and 93.8% respectively. Thus, an improvement of 1.96% in precision, 6.13% in recall and 2.07% in mAP was achieved. The proposed model performs pothole detection as well as perimeter and depth measurement with high accuracy and is suitable for real-time applications due to its low model complexity. In this way, a lightweight and effective model that can be used in deep learning-based intelligent transportation solutions has been acquired.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Verification of Embodied Reasoning for Generative Skill Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11175v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative skill acquisition enables embodied agents to actively learn a scalable and evolving repertoire of control skills, crucial for the advancement of large decision models. While prior approaches often rely on supervision signals from generalist agents (e.g., LLMs), their effectiveness in complex 3D environments remains unclear; exhaustive evaluation incurs substantial computational costs, significantly hindering the efficiency of skill learning. Inspired by recent successes in verification models for mathematical reasoning, we propose VERGSA (Verifying Embodied Reasoning in Generative Skill Acquisition), a framework that systematically integrates real-time verification principles into embodied skill learning. VERGSA establishes 1) a seamless extension from verification of mathematical reasoning into embodied learning by dynamically incorporating contextually relevant tasks into prompts and defining success metrics for both subtasks and overall tasks, and 2) an automated, scalable reward labeling scheme that synthesizes dense reward signals by iteratively finalizing the contribution of scene configuration and subtask learning to overall skill acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this approach constitutes the first comprehensive training dataset for verification-driven generative skill acquisition, eliminating arduous manual reward engineering. Experiments validate the efficacy of our approach: 1) the exemplar task pool improves the average task success rates by 21%, 2) our verification model boosts success rates by 24% for novel tasks and 36% for encountered tasks, and 3) outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines in verification quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring the Most Similar Variable-length Subsequences between Multidimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11106v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding the most similar subsequences between two multidimensional time series has many applications: e.g. capturing dependency in stock market or discovering coordinated movement of baboons. Considering one pattern occurring in one time series, we might be wondering whether the same pattern occurs in another time series with some distortion that might have a different length. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient framework that deals with this problem yet. In this work, we propose an algorithm that provides the exact solution of finding the most similar multidimensional subsequences between time series where there is a difference in length both between time series and between subsequences. The algorithm is built based on theoretical guarantee of correctness and efficiency. The result in simulation datasets illustrated that our approach not just only provided correct solution, but it also utilized running time only quarter of time compared against the baseline approaches. In real-world datasets, it extracted the most similar subsequences even faster (up to 20 times faster against baseline methods) and provided insights regarding the situation in stock market and following relations of multidimensional time series of baboon movement. Our approach can be used for any time series. The code and datasets of this work are provided for the public use.</p></details> | Under review |

However, their real-world effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing, inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture, DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present limitations of LLMs for active fund management. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKUSTDial/DeepFund.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

While enhancing performance through specialized surface properties, these components may encounter difficulties in meeting modified requirements due to standardization in the refurbishment process. This article proposes updating the established coating process for thermally spray coated components for steel manufacturing (TCCSM) by integrating real-time data analytics and predictive quality management. Two essential components--the data aggregator and the quality predictor--are designed through continuous process monitoring and the application of data-driven methodologies to meet the dynamic demands of the evolving steel landscape. The quality predictor is powered by the simple and effective multiple kernel learning strategy with the goal of realizing predictive quality. The data aggregator, designed with sensors, flow meters, and intelligent data processing for the thermal spray coating process, is proposed to facilitate real-time analytics. The performance of this combination was verified using small-scale tests that enabled not only the accurate prediction of coating quality based on the collected data but also proactive notification to the operator as soon as significant deviations are identified.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

While Transformer-based methods effectively capture global dependencies, they often overlook short-term local variations in time series. Recent methods that adapt large language models (LLMs) into time series forecasting inherit this limitation by treating LLMs as black-box encoders, relying solely on the final-layer output and underutilizing hierarchical representations. To address this limitation, we propose Logo-LLM, a novel LLM-based framework that explicitly extracts and models multi-scale temporal features from different layers of a pre-trained LLM. Through empirical analysis, we show that shallow layers of LLMs capture local dynamics in time series, while deeper layers encode global trends. Moreover, Logo-LLM introduces lightweight Local-Mixer and Global-Mixer modules to align and integrate features with the temporal input across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Logo-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks, with strong generalization in few-shot and zero-shot settings while maintaining low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a method according to probability theory to quickly and accurately predict the scaling performance and select the best strategy under large sampling times without extra resource-intensive inference in practice. It can serve as the test-time scaling law for majority voting. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Given users' limited social connections and severe lags in disseminating fresh PoI to all, major LBSNs aim to enhance users' social PoI sharing by selecting $k$ out of $m$ users as hotspots and broadcasting their fresh PoI information to the entire user community. This motivates us to study a new combinatorial optimization problem that involves the interplay between an urban sensing network and an online social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and also renders existing approximation solutions not viable. Through analyzing the interplay effects between the two networks, we successfully transform the involved PoI-sharing process across two networks to matrix computations for deriving a closed-form objective to hold desirable properties (e.g., submodularity and monotonicity). This finding enables us to develop a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees a ($1-\frac{m-2}{m}(\frac{k-1}{k})^k$) approximation of the optimum. Furthermore, we allow each selected user to move around and sense more PoI information to share and propose an augmentation-adaptive algorithm with decent performance guarantees. Finally, our theoretical results are corroborated by our simulation findings using both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is an updated version of our previous paper titled "Approximation Algorithms to Enhance Social Sharing of Fresh Point-of-Interest Information."</p></details> |

This is probably due to the lack of images with clocks at different times in their training set. In this work we explore this issue with one of the latest MLLMs: GPT-4.1 to understand why MLLMs fail to tell the time and whether fine-tuning can solve the problem. The results show how models are making progress in reading the time on analog clocks. But have they really learned to do it, or have they only learned patterns in their training datasets? In this work we put the models to the test with different clocks to illustrate the limitations of MLLMs to abstract and generalize.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks.

Unlike the majority of existing unlearning efforts that focus on designing unlearning algorithms, which are typically implemented reactively when an unlearning request is made during the model deployment phase, Ready2Unlearn shifts the focus to the training phase, adopting a "forward-looking" perspective. Building upon well-established meta-learning principles, Ready2Unlearn proactively trains machine learning models with unlearning readiness, such that they are well prepared and can handle future unlearning requests in a more efficient and principled manner. Ready2Unlearn is model-agnostic and compatible with any gradient ascent-based machine unlearning algorithms. We evaluate the method on both vision and language tasks under various unlearning settings, including class-wise unlearning and random data unlearning. Experimental results show that by incorporating such preparedness at training time, Ready2Unlearn produces an unlearning-ready model state, which offers several key advantages when future unlearning is required, including reduced unlearning time, improved retention of overall model capability, and enhanced resistance to the inadvertent recovery of forgotten data. We hope this work could inspire future efforts to explore more proactive strategies for equipping machine learning models with built-in readiness towards more reliable and principled machine unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Probabilistic Modeling with LLM for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10774v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

Such a scheme is proven to be pressure robust and Reynolds semi-robust. Standard techniques can be used to analyze only the case of lowest-order approximations in time. Therefore, we use some nonstandard test functions to prove existence of discrete solutions, unconditional stability, and quasi-optimal convergence rates for any degree of approximation in time. In particular, a continuous dependence of the discrete solution on the data of the problem, and quasi-optimal convergence rates for low and high Reynolds numbers are proven in an energy norm including the term $L^{\infty}(0, T; L^2(\Omega)^d)$ for the velocity. In addition to the standard discontinuous Galerkin time stepping scheme, which is fully implicit, we propose and analyze a novel high-order semi-implicit version that avoids the need of solving nonlinear systems of equations after the first time slab, thus significantly improving the efficiency of the method. Some numerical experiments validating our theoretical results are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRET: Feature Redundancy Elimination for Test Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10641v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the generalization of deep learning models when faced with test data that exhibits distribution shifts from the training data. In this context, only a pre-trained model and unlabeled test data are available, making it particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive applications. In practice, we observe that feature redundancy in embeddings tends to increase as domain shifts intensify in TTA. However, existing TTA methods often overlook this redundancy, which can hinder the model's adaptability to new data. To address this issue, we introduce Feature Redundancy Elimination for Test-time Adaptation (FRET), a novel perspective for TTA. A straightforward approach (S-FRET) is to directly minimize the feature redundancy score as an optimization objective to improve adaptation. Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, S-FRET struggles with label shifts, limiting its robustness in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, we further propose Graph-based FRET (G-FRET), which integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with contrastive learning. This design not only reduces feature redundancy but also enhances feature discriminability in both the representation and prediction layers. Extensive experiments across multiple model architectures, tasks, and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of S-FRET and show that G-FRET achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further analysis reveals that G-FRET enables the model to extract non-redundant and highly discriminative features during inference, thereby facilitating more robust test-time adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Spectroscopic redshift is the gold-standard method for measuring redshift, but it requires about $1000$ times more telescope time than broad-band imaging. That extra cost limits sky coverage and sample size and puts large spectroscopic surveys out of reach. Photometric redshift methods rely on imaging in multiple color filters and template fitting, yet they ignore the wealth of information carried by galaxy shape and structure. We demonstrate that a diffusion model conditioned on continuous redshift learns this missing joint structure, reproduces known morphology-$z$ correlations. We verify on the HyperSuprime-Cam survey, that the model captures redshift-dependent trends in ellipticity, semi-major axis, S\'ersic index, and isophotal area that these generated images correlate closely with true redshifts on test data. To our knowledge this is the first study to establish a direct link between galaxy morphology and redshift. Our approach offers a simple and effective path to redshift estimation from imaging data and will help unlock the full potential of upcoming wide-field surveys.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the high inference latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://milanganai.github.io/fortress/</p></details> |

Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The majority of numerical techniques for computing invariant sets have been developed for discrete-time systems with a fixed sampling time. Understanding how invariant sets change with sampling time is critical for designing adaptive-sampling control schemes that ensure constraint satisfaction. We introduce M-step hold control invariance, a generalization of traditional control invariance, and show its practical use to assess the link between control sampling frequency and constraint satisfaction. We robustify M-step hold control invariance against model mismatches and discretization errors, paving the way for adaptive-sampling control strategies.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS baselines while being more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/MONAQ</p></details> |

However, existing drone detection systems often struggle in real-world settings due to environmental noise and sensor limitations. This paper introduces TRIDENT, a tri-modal drone detection framework that integrates synchronized audio, visual, and RF data to enhance robustness and reduce dependence on individual sensors. TRIDENT introduces two fusion strategies - Late Fusion and GMU Fusion - to improve multi-modal integration while maintaining efficiency. The framework incorporates domain-specific feature extraction techniques alongside a specialized data augmentation pipeline that simulates real-world sensor degradation to improve generalization capabilities. A diverse multi-sensor dataset is collected in urban and non-urban environments under varying lighting conditions, ensuring comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results show that TRIDENT achieves 98.8 percent accuracy in real-world recordings and 83.26 percent in a more complex setting (augmented data), outperforming unimodal and dual-modal baselines. Moreover, TRIDENT operates in real-time, detecting drones in just 6.09 ms while consuming only 75.27 mJ per detection, making it highly efficient for resource-constrained devices.

The answer changes depending on when the question is asked. While large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on various reasoning tasks, they often miss a crucial dimension: time. In real-world scenarios, the correctness of answers is frequently tied to temporal context. To address this gap, we present a novel framework and dataset spanning over 8,000 events from 2018 to 2024, annotated with day-level granularity and sourced globally across domains such as politics, science, and business. Our TimeShift evaluation method systematically probes LLMs for temporal reasoning, revealing that base models often outperform instruction-tuned and synthetic-trained counterparts on time-sensitive recall. Additionally, we find that even large-scale models exhibit brittleness in handling paraphrased facts, highlighting unresolved challenges in temporal consistency. By identifying these limitations, our work provides a significant step toward advancing time-aware language models capable of adapting to the dynamic nature of real-world knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization: Empowering Multi-dimensional Time Series Classification in Low-Data Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03825v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of multi-dimensional time series from real-world systems require fine-grained learning of complex features such as cross-dimensional dependencies and intra-class variations-all under the practical challenge of low training data availability. However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a "soft" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the "soft" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Expert Systems with Applications (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2025.127889)</p></details> |
| **[Simple and Provable Scaling Laws for the Test-Time Compute of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19477v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.</p></details> |  |

It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy mirror descent.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

| **[Informed Forecasting: Leveraging Auxiliary Knowledge to Boost LLM Performance on Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10213v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The finiteness conjecture for $3 \times 3$ binary matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10178v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The invariant polytope algorithm was a breakthrough in the joint spectral radius computation, allowing to find the exact value of the joint spectral radius for most matrix families~\cite{GP2013,GP2016}. This algorithm found many applications in problems of functional analysis, approximation theory, combinatorics, etc. In this paper we propose a modification of the invariant polytope algorithm enlarging the class of problems to which it is applicable. Precisely, we introduce mixed numeric and symbolic computations. A further minor modification of augmenting the input set with additional matrices speeds up the algorithm in certain cases. With this modifications we are able to automatically prove the finiteness conjecture for all pairs of binary $3\times 3$ matrices and sign $2\times 2$ matrices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Scaling Law Apply in Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10172v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths, alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern, validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Space-Time Multigrid Methods Suitable for Topology Optimisation of Transient Heat Conduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10168v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Space-Time MultiGrid (STMG) methods which are suitable for performing topology optimisation of transient heat conduction problems. The proposed methods use a pointwise smoother and uniform Cartesian space-time meshes. For problems with high contrast in the diffusivity, it was found that it is beneficial to define a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of the minimum and maximum diffusivity. However, other coarsening strategies may be better for other smoothers. Several methods of discretising the coarse levels were tested. Of these, it was best to use a method which averages the thermal resistivities on the finer levels. However, this was likely a consequence of the fact that only one spatial dimension was considered for the test problems. A second coarsening strategy was proposed which ensures spatial resolution on the coarse grids. Mixed results were found for this strategy. The proposed STMG methods were used as a solver for a one-dimensional topology optimisation problem. In this context, the adjoint problem was also solved using the STMG methods. The STMG methods were sufficiently robust for this application, since they converged during every optimisation cycle. It was found that the STMG methods also work for the adjoint problem when the prolongation operator only sends information forwards in time, even although the direction of time for the adjoint problem is backwards.</p></details> | 30 pages, 13 figures |
| **[IMITATE: Image Registration with Context for unknown time frame recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10124v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies.

| **[ChronoSteer: Bridging Large Language Model and Time Series Foundation Model via Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10083v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively. Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM, ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a 22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A mover-stayer model with time-dependent stayer fraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10065v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mover-stayer models are used in social sciences and economics to model heterogeneous population dynamics in which some individuals never experience the event of interest ("stayers"), while others transition between states over time ("movers"). Conventionally, the mover-stayer status is determined at baseline and time-dependent covariates are only incorporated in the movers' transition probabilities. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic version of the mover-stayer model, allowing potential movers to become stayers over time based on time-varying circumstances. Using a multinomial logistic framework, our model incorporates both time-fixed and exogenous time-varying covariates to estimate transition probabilities among the states of potential movers, movers, and stayers. Both the initial state and transitions to the stayer state are treated as latent. The introduction of this new model is motivated by the study of student mobility. Specifically focusing on panel data on the inter-university mobility of Italian students, factors such as the students' change of course and university size are considered as time-varying covariates in modelling their probability of moving or becoming stayers; sex and age at enrolment as time-fixed covariates. We propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach and investigate its finite-sample performance through simulations, comparing it to established models in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-driven identification of repetitions in multi-variate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10004v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears at 6th Interdisciplinary Data Science Conference (iDSC'25)</p></details> |
| **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

| **[A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02817v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence, cross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results. Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one univariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction in mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal component analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series embeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give scores that are within a given epsilon of each other. We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several pairs of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of cross-recurrence, and show the increased accuracy and stability of our score when predicting and measuring whether or not the periodicities of two time series are similar.</p></details> |  |

In real-world applications, models are typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains. Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.</p></details> | 18 pages,12 figures |

As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X}, y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods. TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1% accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition matrices.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Accept |

This paradigm distinctively addresses two major limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems, we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Video diffusion models (VDMs) are the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics. However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily time steps.</p></details> |  |

Many of our results are optimal. For sub-Gaussian distributions we also provide a CSS which tracks a time-varying mean, generalizing Robbins' mixture approach to the multivariate setting. Finally, we provide several CSSs for heavy-tailed random vectors (two moments only). Our bounds hold under a martingale assumption on the mean and do not require that the observations be iid.

Dissimilarity-based approaches, such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), are classical methods for distinguishing time series when time deformations are confounding information. In this paper, starting from a deformation-based model for signal classes we define a problem statement for time series classification problem. We show that, under theoretically ideal conditions, a continuous version of classic 1NN-DTW method can solve the stated problem, even when only one training sample is available. In addition, we propose an alternative dissimilarity measure based on Optimal Transport and show that it can also solve the aforementioned problem statement at a significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the newly proposed approach in simulated and real time series classification data, showing the efficacy of the method.</p></details> |  |

If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

They are among the interesting subgraphs in network analysis to get insights on both the local and global structure of a network. While several algorithms exist for discovering and enumerating graphlets, the cost per solution of such algorithms typically depends on the size of the graph $G$, or its maximum degree. In real networks, even the latter can be in the order of millions, whereas $k$ is typically required to be a small value. In this paper we provide the first algorithm to list all graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ with an amortized cost per solution depending \emph{solely} on the order $k$, contrarily to previous approaches where the cost depends \emph{also} on the size of $G$ or its maximum degree. Specifically, we show that it is possible to list $k$-graphlets in $O(k^2)$ time per solution, and to list edge $k$-graphlets in $O(k)$ time per solution. Furthermore we show that, if the input graph has bounded degree, then the cost per solution for listing $k$-graphlets is reduced to $O(k)$. Whenever $k = O(1)$, as it is often the case in practical settings, these algorithms are the first to achieve constant time per solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the paper at Algorithmica (2025), after peer review</p></details> |
| **[Time Can Invalidate Algorithmic Recourse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08007v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic Recourse (AR) aims to provide users with actionable steps to overturn unfavourable decisions made by machine learning predictors. However, these actions often take time to implement (e.g., getting a degree can take years), and their effects may vary as the world evolves. Thus, it is natural to ask for recourse that remains valid in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we study the robustness of algorithmic recourse over time by casting the problem through the lens of causality. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that (even robust) causal AR methods can fail over time, except in the -- unlikely -- case that the world is stationary. Even more critically, unless the world is fully deterministic, counterfactual AR cannot be solved optimally. To account for this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm for temporal AR that explicitly accounts for time under the assumption of having access to an estimator approximating the stochastic process. Our simulations on synthetic and realistic datasets show how considering time produces more resilient solutions to potential trends in the data distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a paper accepted at FAccT 2025.

However, real-time interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings -- $\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation (TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present $\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$, a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a strong baseline, yet overall performance remains modest -- highlighting the difficulty of TGLG and motivating further research in real-time VLMs. Code and data available $\href{https://github.com/yukw777/tglg}{here}$.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Users are analyzed post-by-post, and it is necessary to guarantee correct and quick answers, which is particularly challenging in critical scenarios. ERD involves optimizing classification precision and minimizing detection delay. Standard classification metrics may not suffice, resorting to specific metrics such as ERDE(theta) that explicitly consider precision and delay. The current research focuses on applying a multi-objective approach, prioritizing classification performance and establishing a separate criterion for decision time. In this work, we propose a completely different strategy, temporal fine-tuning, which allows tuning transformer-based models by explicitly incorporating time within the learning process. Our method allows us to analyze complete user post histories, tune models considering different contexts, and evaluate training performance using temporal metrics. We evaluated our proposal in the depression and eating disorders tasks for the Spanish language, achieving competitive results compared to the best models of MentalRiskES 2023. We found that temporal fine-tuning optimized decisions considering context and time progress. In this way, by properly taking advantage of the power of transformers, it is possible to address ERD by combining precision and speed as a single objective.</p></details> | <details><summary>In: P...</summary><p>In: Proceedings of the 53rd JAIIO / 50th CLEI - ASAID, 2024, p. 137.

SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[IssueCourier: Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network for Open-Source Issue Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11205v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue assignment plays a critical role in open-source software (OSS) maintenance, which involves recommending the most suitable developers to address the reported issues. Given the high volume of issue reports in large-scale projects, manually assigning issues is tedious and costly. Previous studies have proposed automated issue assignment approaches that primarily focus on modeling issue report textual information, developers' expertise, or interactions between issues and developers based on historical issue-fixing records. However, these approaches often suffer from performance limitations due to the presence of incorrect and missing labels in OSS datasets, as well as the long tail of developer contributions and the changes of developer activity as the project evolves. To address these challenges, we propose IssueCourier, a novel Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network approach for issue assignment. Specifically, we formalize five key relationships among issues, developers, and source code files to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we further adopt a temporal slicing technique that partitions the graph into a sequence of time-based subgraphs to learn stage-specific patterns. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark dataset with relabeled ground truth to address the problem of incorrect and missing labels in existing OSS datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of IssueCourier, we conduct extensive experiments on our benchmark dataset. The results show that IssueCourier can improve over the best baseline up to 45.49% in top-1 and 31.97% in MRR.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Fault Diagnosis across Heterogeneous Domains via Self-Adaptive Temporal-Spatial Attention and Sample Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11083v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have shown promising performance in fault diagnosis for multimode process. Most existing studies assume that the collected health state categories from different operating modes are identical. However, in real industrial scenarios, these categories typically exhibit only partial overlap. The incompleteness of the available data and the large distributional differences between the operating modes pose a significant challenge to existing fault diagnosis methods. To address this problem, a novel fault diagnosis model named self-adaptive temporal-spatial attention network (TSA-SAN) is proposed. First, inter-mode mappings are constructed using healthy category data to generate multimode samples. To enrich the diversity of the fault data, interpolation is performed between healthy and fault samples. Subsequently, the fault diagnosis model is trained using real and generated data. The self-adaptive instance normalization is established to suppress irrelevant information while retaining essential statistical features for diagnosis. In addition, a temporal-spatial attention mechanism is constructed to focus on the key features, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available on Github at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/TSA-SAN.</p></details> | 31 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Physics-informed Temporal Alignment for Auto-regressive PDE Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10930v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction, causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation models on diverse time-dependent PDE data.

We present a novel framework for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant development in discrete time steps. We evaluate the approach on data from the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center, demonstrating detailed temporal reconstructions of Sequoia and Quinoa species.

| **[Are Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks for Human Action Recognition Over-Parameterized?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10679v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) showcase impressive performance in skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR). However, despite the development of numerous models, their recognition performance does not differ significantly after aligning the input settings. With this observation, we hypothesize that ST-GCNs are over-parameterized for HAR, a conjecture subsequently confirmed through experiments employing the lottery ticket hypothesis. Additionally, a novel sparse ST-GCNs generator is proposed, which trains a sparse architecture from a randomly initialized dense network while maintaining comparable performance levels to the dense components. Moreover, we generate multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs by integrating sparse structures at various sparsity levels and demonstrate that the assembled model yields a significant enhancement in HAR performance. Thorough experiments on four datasets, including NTU-RGB+D 60(120), Kinetics-400, and FineGYM, demonstrate that the proposed sparse ST-GCNs can achieve comparable performance to their dense components. Even with 95% fewer parameters, the sparse ST-GCNs exhibit a degradation of <1% in top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs, which require only 66% of the parameters of the dense ST-GCNs, demonstrate an improvement of >1% in top-1 accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/davelailai/Sparse-ST-GCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 16 figures |

To train SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold, referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy.

| **[ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

| **[How to Color Temporal Graphs to Ensure Proper Transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10207v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Coloring consists in assigning colors to vertices ensuring that two adjacent vertices do not have the same color. In dynamic graphs, this notion is not well defined, as we need to decide if different colors for adjacent vertices must happen all the time or not, and how to go from a coloring in one time to the next one. In this paper, we define a coloring notion for Temporal Graphs where at each step, the coloring must be proper. It uses a notion of compatibility between two consecutive snapshots that implies that the coloring stays proper while the transition happens. Given a graph, the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that such coloring exists is the \emph{Temporal Chromatic Number} of this graph. With those notions, we provide some lower and upper bounds for the temporal chromatic number in the general case. We then dive into some specific classes of graphs such as trees, graphs with bounded degree or bounded degeneracy. Finally, we consider temporal graphs where grow pace is one, that is, a single edge can be added and a single other one can be removed between two time steps. In that case, we consider bipartite and bounded degree graphs. Even though the problem is defined with full knowledge of the temporal graph, our results also work in the case where future snapshots are given online: we need to choose the coloring of the next snapshot after having computed the current one, not knowing what</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Closure and Complexity of Temporal Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10186v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causality defines what property causes some observed temporal behavior (the effect) in a given computation, based on a counterfactual analysis of similar computations. In this paper, we study its closure properties and the complexity of computing causes. For the former, we establish that safety, reachability, and recurrence properties are all closed under causal inference: If the effect is from one of these property classes, then the cause for this effect is from the same class. We also show that persistence and obligation properties are not closed in this way. These results rest on a topological characterization of causes which makes them applicable to a wide range of similarity relations between computations. Finally, our complexity analysis establishes improved upper bounds for computing causes for safety, reachability, and recurrence properties. We also present the first lower bounds for all of the classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forti...</summary><p>Fortieth Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10080v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+35...</summary><p>14+35 pages, 6+5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Triplane Transformers as Occupancy World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07338v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models aim to learn or construct representations of the environment that enable the prediction of future scenes, thereby supporting intelligent motion planning. However, existing models often struggle to produce fine-grained predictions and to operate in real time. In this work, we propose T$^3$Former, a novel 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact {\em triplane} representation that efficiently encodes 3D occupancy. It then extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from historical triplanes and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict future triplane changes. Finally, these triplane changes are combined with previous states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results show that T$^3$Former achieves 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS), improves mean IoU to 36.09, and reduces mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters. Demos are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Existing deep learning models often lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic, direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable, and real-time solution for urban traffic management and optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Scaling Law for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17785v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in a wide range of tasks, leading to increasing attention towards the research on how scaling LLMs affects their performance. Existing works, termed Scaling Laws, have discovered that the final test loss of LLMs scales as power-laws with model size, computational budget, and dataset size. However, the temporal change of the test loss of an LLM throughout its pre-training process remains unexplored, though it is valuable in many aspects, such as selecting better hyperparameters \textit{directly} on the target LLM. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Temporal Scaling Law, studying how the test loss of an LLM evolves as the training steps scale up. In contrast to modeling the test loss as a whole in a coarse-grained manner, we break it down and dive into the fine-grained test loss of each token position, and further develop a dynamic hyperbolic-law. Afterwards, we derive the much more precise temporal scaling law by studying the temporal patterns of the parameters in the dynamic hyperbolic-law. Results on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) validation datasets demonstrate that our temporal scaling law accurately predicts the test loss of LLMs across training steps. Our temporal scaling law has broad practical applications. First, it enables direct and efficient hyperparameter selection on the target LLM, such as data mixture proportions. Secondly, viewing the LLM pre-training dynamics from the token position granularity provides some insights to enhance the understanding of LLM pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Currently under review</p></details> |
| **[ChronoFact: Timeline-based Temporal Fact Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14964v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal claims, often riddled with inaccuracies, are a significant challenge in the digital misinformation landscape. Fact-checking systems that can accurately verify such claims are crucial for combating misinformation. Current systems struggle with the complexities of evaluating the accuracy of these claims, especially when they include multiple, overlapping, or recurring events. We introduce a novel timeline-based fact verification framework that identify events from both claim and evidence and organize them into their respective chronological timelines. The framework systematically examines the relationships between the events in both claim and evidence to predict the veracity of each claim event and their chronological accuracy. This allows us to accurately determine the overall veracity of the claim. We also introduce a new dataset of complex temporal claims involving timeline-based reasoning for the training and evaluation of our proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling the intricacies of temporal claim verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Difference Variational Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07812v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deontic Temporal Logic for Formal Verification of AI Ethics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05765v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring ethical behavior in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems amidst their increasing ubiquity and influence is a major concern the world over. The use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications, contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixels: Leveraging the Language of Soccer to Improve Spatio-Temporal Action Detection in Broadcast Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09455v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) methods show promising results for extracting soccer events from broadcast videos. However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |
| **[MUST: Multi-Scale Structural-Temporal Link Prediction Model for UAV Ad Hoc Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09331v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks (UANETs) aims to predict the potential formation of future links between UAVs. In adversarial environments where the route information of UAVs is unavailable, predicting future links must rely solely on the observed historical topological information of UANETs. However, the highly dynamic and sparse nature of UANET topologies presents substantial challenges in effectively capturing meaningful structural and temporal patterns for accurate link prediction. Most existing link prediction methods focus on temporal dynamics at a single structural scale while neglecting the effects of sparsity, resulting in insufficient information capture and limited applicability to UANETs. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale structural-temporal link prediction model (MUST) for UANETs. Specifically, we first employ graph attention networks (GATs) to capture structural features at multiple levels, including the individual UAV level, the UAV community level, and the overall network level. Then, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the temporal dynamics of these multi-scale structural features. Additionally, we address the impact of sparsity by introducing a sophisticated loss function during model optimization. We validate the performance of MUST using several UANET datasets generated through simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MUST achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance in highly dynamic and sparse UANETs.</p></details> |  |

By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA |

By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[RT-GAN: Recurrent Temporal GAN for Adding Lightweight Temporal Consistency to Frame-Based Domain Translation Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00868v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fourteen million colonoscopies are performed annually just in the U.S. However, the videos from these colonoscopies are not saved due to storage constraints (each video from a high-definition colonoscope camera can be in tens of gigabytes). Instead, a few relevant individual frames are saved for documentation/reporting purposes and these are the frames on which most current colonoscopy AI models are trained on. While developing new unsupervised domain translation methods for colonoscopy (e.g. to translate between real optical and virtual/CT colonoscopy), it is thus typical to start with approaches that initially work for individual frames without temporal consistency. Once an individual-frame model has been finalized, additional contiguous frames are added with a modified deep learning architecture to train a new model from scratch for temporal consistency. This transition to temporally-consistent deep learning models, however, requires significantly more computational and memory resources for training. In this paper, we present a lightweight solution with a tunable temporal parameter, RT-GAN (Recurrent Temporal GAN), for adding temporal consistency to individual frame-based approaches that reduces training requirements by a factor of 5. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two challenging use cases in colonoscopy: haustral fold segmentation (indicative of missed surface) and realistic colonoscopy simulator video generation. We also release a first-of-its kind temporal dataset for colonoscopy for the above use cases. The datasets, accompanying code, and pretrained models will be made available on our Computational Endoscopy Platform GitHub (https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP).

The aim is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, evolves over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture how samples from a continuous-time stochastic process evolve over the time. To model potential distribution shifts over time, we introduce a time-dependent function parameterized by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) and estimate it non--parametrically using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The proposed model is highly interpretable, detects subtle temporal shifts, and remains computationally efficient. Through simulation studies, we show that it performs competitively in terms of estimation accuracy against state-of-the-art, less interpretable methods such as normalized gradient--flows and non--parameteric kernel density estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method on digital clinical--trial data, showing how the interventions alters the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels and enabling a rigorous comparison of control and treatment groups from novel mathematical and clinical perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural-Temporal Coupling Anomaly Detection with Dynamic Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08330v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is an important task in many applications over evolving triple-based data, such as social networks, transaction management, and epidemiology. A major challenge with this task is the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances. Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model. Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then, a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength of our method when applied to a real-world task.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Complexity-adaptive Temporal Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06164v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor decomposition is a fundamental tool for analyzing multi-dimensional data by learning low-rank factors to represent high-order interactions. While recent works on temporal tensor decomposition have made significant progress by incorporating continuous timestamps in latent factors, they still struggle with general tensor data with continuous indexes not only in the temporal mode but also in other modes, such as spatial coordinates in climate data. Moreover, the challenge of self-adapting model complexity is largely unexplored in functional temporal tensor models, with existing methods being inapplicable in this setting. To address these limitations, we propose functional \underline{C}omplexity-\underline{A}daptive \underline{T}emporal \underline{T}ensor d\underline{E}composition (\textsc{Catte}). Our approach encodes continuous spatial indexes as learnable Fourier features and employs neural ODEs in latent space to learn the temporal trajectories of factors. To enable automatic adaptation of model complexity, we introduce a sparsity-inducing prior over the factor trajectories. We develop an efficient variational inference scheme with an analytical evidence lower bound, enabling sampling-free optimization. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that \textsc{Catte} not only reveals the underlying ranks of functional temporal tensors but also significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction performance and robustness against noise.</p></details> |  |

This includes a proof of contravariant equivalence and a congruence/filter/closed-upset correspondence. We then study two notions of {\guillemotleft} reachability {\guillemotright} on the relevant spaces/frames and show their equivalence in the finite case. We use these notions of reachability to give both lattice-theoretic and dual order-topological characterisations of simple and subdirectly-irreducible temporal Heyting algebras. Finally, we apply our duality results to prove the relational and algebraic finite model property for the temporal Heyting calculus. This, in conjunction with the proven characterisations, allows us to prove a relational completeness result that combines finiteness and the frame property dual to subdirect-irreducibility, giving us a class of finite, well-understood frames for the logic.</p></details> |  |

Existing contrastive language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong benchmark. The dataset and our source code are available on Zenodo and GitHub, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA), 2025.

However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive importance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts. Besides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To address these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named HALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring the half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three modules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact attention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to identify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is designed for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we construct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the temporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show that HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering outdated facts (Codes are available at https://github.com/yushuowiki/K-Half/tree/main ).</p></details> |  |

Current approaches are either focused on static image reconstruction but too computationally intensive, or achieve high quality through per-video optimization that requires minutes to hours of processing, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To this end, we present TemPoFast3D, a novel method that leverages temporal coherency of human appearance to reduce redundant computation while maintaining reconstruction quality. Our approach is a "plug-and play" solution that uniquely transforms pixel-aligned reconstruction networks to handle continuous video streams by maintaining and refining a canonical appearance representation through efficient coordinate mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemPoFast3D matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across standard metrics while providing high-quality textured reconstruction across diverse pose and appearance, with a maximum speed of 12 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This letter proposes a two-stage framework to address this challenge. First, exponentially decaying tracking error bounds are derived with multidimensional geometric control gains obtained via differential evolution. These bounds are less conservative, while the resulting tracking errors exhibit smaller oscillations and improved transient performance. Second, leveraging the time-varying bounds, a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) formulation generates piecewise B\'ezier reference trajectories that satisfy STL and velocity limits, while ensuring inter-agent safety through convex-hull properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables formally verifiable multi-agent coordination in constrained environments, with provable tracking guarantees under bounded disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

By investigating cosmic signal delay, neurological reaction times, and the ancient cognitive state of stillness, we explore how one may shift from reactive perception to a conscious interface with the near future. This paper introduces both a physical and cognitive model for perceiving the present not as a linear timestamp, but as an interference zone where early-arriving cosmic signals and reactive human delays intersect. We propose experimental approaches to test these ideas using human neural observation and neuro-receptive extensions. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework to guide the evolution of AI systems toward temporally efficient, ethically sound, and internally conscious decision-making processes</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

The knowledge acquisition at a certain time point may be strongly inspired with the help of previous experience. Thus the knowledge growing procedure should show strong relationship along the temporal dimension. In our research, we find that during the network training, the evolution of feature map follows temporal sequence property. A proper temporal supervision may further improve the network training performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose Temporal Supervised Knowledge Distillation (TSKD). Specifically, we extract the spatiotemporal features in the different training phases of student by convolutional Long Short-term memory network (Conv-LSTM). Then, we train the student net through a dynamic target, rather than static teacher network features. This process realizes the refinement of old knowledge in student network, and utilizes it to assist current learning. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and advantages of our method over existing knowledge distillation methods, including various network architectures and different tasks (image classification and object detection) .</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is outdated and needs new improvements to make it valuable</p></details> |

While network diameter has been extensively studied in static networks, its definition and behavior in temporal networks remain underexplored due to their dynamic nature. In this study, we present a formal mathematical framework for analyzing diameter in temporal networks and introduce three time-aware metrics: Effective Diameter , Peak Diameter (*D), and t-Diameter (tD), each capturing distinct temporal aspects of connectivity and diffusion. Our approach combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation using four real-world datasets: high school, hospital, conference, and workplace contact networks. We simulate flow propagation on temporal networks and compare the observed diameters with the proposed theoretical Equations. Across all datasets, our model demonstrates high accuracy, with low RMSE and absolute error values. Furthermore, we observe that the effective diameter decreases with increasing average degree and increases with network size. The results also show that tD and *D are more sensitive to node removal, highlighting their relevance for applications such as epidemic modeling. By bridging formal modeling and empirical data, our framework offers new insights into the temporal dynamics of networked systems and provides tools for assessing robustness, controlling information spread, and optimizing interventions in time-sensitive environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Monotonic Modeling with Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Awareness in Diverse Marketing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14132v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the mobile internet era, the Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) emerges as an integral component of inclusive finance owing to the convenience it brings to people. OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |

For an anchor sample, most existing approaches generate negative samples either from other videos or within the same video for contrastive learning. However, some training samples are highly similar to the anchor sample, directly regarding them as negative samples leads to difficulties for optimization and ignores the correlations between these similar samples and the anchor sample. To address this, we propose Positive Sample Mining (PSM), a novel framework that mines positive samples from the training set to provide more discriminative supervision. Specifically, for a given anchor sample, we partition the remaining training set into semantically similar and dissimilar subsets based on the similarity of their text queries. To effectively leverage these correlations, we introduce a PSM-guided contrastive loss to ensure that the anchor proposal is closer to similar samples and further from dissimilar ones. Additionally, we design a PSM-guided rank loss to ensure that similar samples are closer to the anchor proposal than to the negative intra-video proposal, aiming to distinguish the anchor proposal and the negative intra-video proposal. Experiments on the WSTSG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>TCSVT...</summary><p>TCSVT 2025, doi at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970001</p></details> |

In this paper, we study efficient solutions to temporal graph applications using new algorithms for Incremental Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). The first contribution of this work is to formally discuss how a broad set of setting-problem combinations of temporal graph processing can be solved using incremental MST, along with their theoretical guarantees. Despite the importance of the problem, we observe a gap between theory and practice for efficient incremental MST algorithms. While many classic data structures, such as the link-cut tree, provide strong bounds for incremental MST, their performance is limited in practice. Meanwhile, existing practical solutions used in applications do not have any non-trivial theoretical guarantees. Our second and main contribution includes new algorithms for incremental MST that are efficient both in theory and in practice. Our new data structure, the AM-tree, achieves the same theoretical bound as the link-cut tree for temporal graph processing and shows strong performance in practice. In our experiments, the AM-tree has competitive or better performance than existing practical solutions due to theoretical guarantees, and can be significantly faster than the link-cut tree (7.8-11x in updates and 7.7-13.7x in queries).</p></details> |  |

This temporal and spatial variation challenges the effectiveness of fixed-distance quantum error correction (QEC) codes. In this paper, we analyze 12 days of calibration data from IBM's 127-qubit device (ibm_kyiv), showing the fluctuation of Pauli-X and CNOT gate error rates. We demonstrate that fixed-distance QEC can either underperform or lead to excessive overhead, depending on the selected qubit and the error rate of the day. We then propose a simple adaptive QEC approach that selects an appropriate code distance per qubit, based on daily error rates. Using logical error rate modeling, we identify qubits that cannot be used and qubits that can be recovered with minimal resources. Our method avoids unnecessary resource overhead by excluding outlier qubits and tailoring code distances. Across 12 calibration days on ibm_kyiv, our adaptive strategy reduces physical qubit overhead by over 50% per logical qubit while maintaining access to 85-100% of usable qubits. To further validate the method, we repeat the experiment on two additional 127-qubit devices, ibm_brisbane and ibm_sherbrooke, where the overhead savings reach up to 71% while still preserving over 80% qubit usability. This approach offers a practical and efficient path forward for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era QEC strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

Despite the effectiveness of the existing models, they struggle to fully address the unique challenges of TAD, such as the redundancy in multi-scale features and the limited ability to capture sufficient temporal context. To address these issues, we propose a multi-dilated gated encoder and central-adjacent region integrated decoder for temporal action detection transformer (DiGIT). Our approach replaces the existing encoder that consists of multi-scale deformable attention and feedforward network with our multi-dilated gated encoder. Our proposed encoder reduces the redundant information caused by multi-level features while maintaining the ability to capture fine-grained and long-range temporal information. Furthermore, we introduce a central-adjacent region integrated decoder that leverages a more comprehensive sampling strategy for deformable cross-attention to capture the essential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.3, and HACS-Segment.

Recently, self-supervised learning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without requiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for training neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these methods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key properties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and geodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the Eikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex and unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of optimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid spurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the Eikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in handling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with robot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, error-bounded lossy compression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression ratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the inherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing opportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a novel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific data. We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate a graph representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations. Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph autoencoder to learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size of the graph, effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses the process and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent representation to reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The decompressed data are guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error bound. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy methods (i.e., HPEZ, SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic data. GRAPHCOMP consistently achieves the highest compression ratio across most datasets, outperforming the second-best method by margins ranging from 22% to 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[USTEP: Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning under A Unified View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05829v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal predictive learning plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, with wide-ranging applications across a diverse range of fields. Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

We formulate STL constraints as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and recast it as a scenario optimization program (SOP) to construct STTs with formal correctness guarantees. We also propose a closed-form control law that operates independently of the system dynamics, and ensures the system trajectory evolves within the STTs, thereby satisfying the STL specifications. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency, trajectory quality, and applicability to complex STL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Spectrum Analysis for Multi-Constellation Space Domain Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05149v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Space Domain Awareness (SDA) system has different major aspects including continues and robust awareness from the network that is crucial for an efficient control over all actors in space. The observability of the space assets on the other hand requires efficient analysis on when and how observed space objects can be controlled. This becomes crucial when real-world spatial dynamics are taken into account as it introduces complexities into the system. The real-world dynamics can reveal the structure of the network including isolated and dominant stations. We propose a Temporal Spectrum Analysis (TSA) scheme that takes into account a set of real-world parameters including actual dynamics of the objects in space to analyze the structure of a ground-space network that inherits temporal spectrum as the key element of design. We study the potential interactions between multiple constellations using TSA and conduct a comprehensive real-world simulations to quantify the structure of the network. Numerical results show how the temporal spectrum of each satellite affects the intra- and inter-constellation network structure including interactions between ground stations and constellations.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where knowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension. In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures, and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious reference for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations. Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising research directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements that have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |

While these predominantly analog optical accelerators bypass digitization to perform parallel floating-point computations, scaling optical hardware to map large-vector sizes for AI tasks remains challenging. Here, we overcome this limitation by unfolding scalar operations in time and introducing a photonic-heater-in-lightpath (PHIL) unit for all-optical temporal integration. Counterintuitively, we exploit a slow heat dissipation process to integrate optical signals modulated at 50 GHz bridging the speed gap between the widely applied thermo-optic effects and ultrafast photonics. This architecture supports optical end-to-end signal processing, eliminates inefficient electro-optical conversions, and enables both linear and nonlinear operations within a unified framework. Our results demonstrate a scalable path towards high-speed photonic computing through thermally driven integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly-supervised Audio Temporal Forgery Localization via Progressive Audio-language Co-learning Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01880v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations, which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives. In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on three public benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9page...</summary><p>9pages, 5figures.

The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Task Offloading and Channel Allocation in Spatial-Temporal Dynamic for MEC Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04272v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computation offloading and resource allocation are critical in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems to handle the massive and complex requirements of applications restricted by limited resources. In a multi-user multi-server MEC network, the mobility of terminals causes computing requests to be dynamically distributed in space. At the same time, the non-negligible dependencies among tasks in some specific applications impose temporal correlation constraints on the solution as well, leading the time-adjacent tasks to experience varying resource availability and competition from parallel counterparts. To address such dynamic spatial-temporal characteristics as a challenge in the allocation of communication and computation resources, we formulate a long-term delay-energy trade-off cost minimization problem in the view of jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. We begin by designing a priority evaluation scheme to decouple task dependencies and then develop a grouped Knapsack problem for channel allocation considering the current data load and channel status. Afterward, in order to meet the rapid response needs of MEC systems, we exploit the double duel deep Q network (D3QN) to make offloading decisions and integrate channel allocation results into the reward as part of the dynamic environment feedback in D3QN, constituting the joint optimization of task offloading and channel allocation. Finally, comprehensive simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the delay-energy trade-off cost and its adaptability for various applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Photovoltaic Power Forecasting: An iTransformer and LSTM-Based Model Integrating Temporal and Covariate Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02302v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is critical for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid, optimizing real-time energy management, and ensuring energy reliability amidst increasing demand. However, existing models often struggle with effectively capturing the complex relationships between target variables and covariates, as well as the interactions between temporal dynamics and multivariate data, leading to suboptimal forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture that leverages the iTransformer for feature extraction from target variables and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from covariates. A cross-attention mechanism is integrated to fuse the outputs of both models, followed by a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) mapping for enhanced representation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated using publicly available datasets from Australia, with experiments conducted across four seasons. Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively capture seasonal variations in PV power generation and improve forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

While models such as Izhikevich can replicate a wide range of these firing dynamics, their complexity poses challenges for directly integrating them into scalable spiking neural networks (SNN) training pipelines. In this work, we propose two probabilistically driven, input-level temporal spike transformations: Poisson-Burst and Delayed-Burst that introduce biologically inspired temporal variability directly into standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This enables scalable training and systematic evaluation of how spike timing dynamics affect privacy, generalization, and learning performance. Poisson-Burst modulates burst occurrence based on input intensity, while Delayed-Burst encodes input strength through burst onset timing. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Poisson-Burst maintains competitive accuracy and lower resource overhead while exhibiting enhanced privacy robustness against membership inference attacks, whereas Delayed-Burst provides stronger privacy protection at a modest accuracy trade-off. These findings highlight the potential of biologically grounded temporal spike dynamics in improving the privacy, generalization and biological plausibility of neuromorphic learning systems.</p></details> |  |

To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI-2025</p></details> |

Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the American Control Conference (ACC) 2025</p></details> |

Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

However, the omission of the object region by erroneous pseudo-label or the introduction of background noise affects the efficiency of modality fusion, while pseudo-label noise triggered by similar object noise can further affect the tracking performance. In this paper, we propose GDSTrack, a novel approach that introduces dynamic graph fusion and temporal diffusion to address the above challenges in self-supervised RGB-T tracking. GDSTrack dynamically fuses the modalities of neighboring frames, treats them as distractor noise, and leverages the denoising capability of a generative model. Specifically, by constructing an adjacency matrix via an Adjacency Matrix Generator (AMG), the proposed Modality-guided Dynamic Graph Fusion (MDGF) module uses a dynamic adjacency matrix to guide graph attention, focusing on and fusing the object's coherent regions. Temporal Graph-Informed Diffusion (TGID) models MDGF features from neighboring frames as interference, and thus improving robustness against similar-object noise. Extensive experiments conducted on four public RGB-T tracking datasets demonstrate that GDSTrack outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07012v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool widely used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Recently, generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism.

| **[FolAI: Synchronized Foley Sound Generation with Semantic and Temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional sound design workflows rely on manual alignment of audio events to visual cues, as in Foley sound design, where everyday actions like footsteps or object interactions are recreated to match the on-screen motion. This process is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and lacks automation tools that preserve creative intent. Despite recent advances in vision-to-audio generation, producing temporally coherent and semantically controllable sound effects from video remains a major challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce FolAI, a two-stage generative framework that decouples the when and the what of sound synthesis, i.e., the temporal structure extraction and the semantically guided generation, respectively. In the first stage, we estimate a smooth control signal from the video that captures the motion intensity and rhythmic structure over time, serving as a temporal scaffold for the audio. In the second stage, a diffusion-based generative model produces sound effects conditioned both on this temporal envelope and on high-level semantic embeddings, provided by the user, that define the desired auditory content (e.g., material or action type). This modular design enables precise control over both timing and timbre, streamlining repetitive tasks while preserving creative flexibility in professional Foley workflows. Results on diverse visual contexts, such as footstep generation and action-specific sonorization, demonstrate that our model reliably produces audio that is temporally aligned with visual motion, semantically consistent with user intent, and perceptually realistic. These findings highlight the potential of FolAI as a controllable and modular solution for scalable, high-quality Foley sound synthesis in professional and interactive settings. Supplementary materials are accessible on our dedicated demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/FolAI.</p></details> |  |

Often, the input is time-evolving, shifting the goal to tracking the evolution of the underlying patterns instead. To adapt to this more complex setting, existing methods incorporate temporal regularization but they either have overly constrained structural requirements or lack uniqueness which is crucial for interpretation. In this paper, in order to capture the underlying evolving patterns, we introduce t(emporal)PARAFAC2, which utilizes temporal smoothness regularization on the evolving factors. Previously, Alternating Optimization (AO) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithmic approach has been introduced to fit the PARAFAC2 model to fully observed data. In this paper, we extend this algorithmic framework to the case of partially observed data and use it to fit the tPARAFAC2 model to complete and incomplete datasets with the goal of revealing evolving patterns. Our numerical experiments on simulated datasets demonstrate that tPARAFAC2 can extract the underlying evolving patterns more accurately compared to the state-of-the-art in the presence of high amounts of noise and missing data. Using two real datasets, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic approach in terms of handling missing data and tPARAFAC2 model in terms of revealing evolving patterns. The paper provides an extensive comparison of different approaches for handling missing data within the proposed framework, and discusses both the advantages and limitations of tPARAFAC2 model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |
| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal error estimates of a second-order temporally finite element method for electrohydrodynamic equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02345v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we mainly present the optimal convergence rates of the temporally second-order finite element scheme for solving the electrohydrodynamic equation. Suffering from the highly coupled nonlinearity, the convergence analysis of the numerical schemes for such a system is rather rare, not to mention the optimal error estimates for the high-order temporally scheme. To this end, we abandon the traditional error analysis method following the process of energy estimate, which may lead to the loss of accuracy. Instead, we note that the charge density also possesses the "energy" decaying property directly derived by its governing equation, although it does not appear in the energy stability analysis. This fact allows us to control the error terms of the charge density more conveniently, which finally leads to the optimal convergence rates. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results, including the energy stability, mass conservation, and convergence rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v4)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

In particular, the recurrent-based VSR model exploits long-range temporal information during inference and achieves superior detail restoration. However, effectively learning these long-term dependencies within long videos remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose LRTI-VSR, a novel training framework for recurrent VSR that efficiently leverages Long-Range Refocused Temporal Information. Our framework includes a generic training strategy that utilizes temporal propagation features from long video clips while training on shorter video clips. Additionally, we introduce a refocused intra&inter-frame transformer block which allows the VSR model to selectively prioritize useful temporal information through its attention module while further improving inter-frame information utilization in the FFN module. We evaluate LRTI-VSR on both CNN and transformer-based VSR architectures, conducting extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each component. Experiments on long-video test sets demonstrate that LRTI-VSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining training and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Existing methods usually focus on implicitly modeling audio and visual features through weak labels, without mining semantic relationships for different modalities and explicit modeling of event temporal dependencies. This makes it difficult for the model to accurately parse event information for each segment under weak supervision, especially when high similarity between segmental modal features leads to ambiguous event boundaries. Hence, we propose a multimodal optimization framework, TeMTG, that combines text enhancement and multi-hop temporal graph modeling. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained multimodal models to generate modality-specific text embeddings, and fuse them with audio-visual features to enhance the semantic representation of these features. In addition, we introduce a multi-hop temporal graph neural network, which explicitly models the local temporal relationships between segments, capturing the temporal continuity of both short-term and long-range events. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators in the LLP dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient 3D Full-Body Motion Generation from Sparse Tracking Inputs with Temporal Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01802v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To have a seamless user experience on immersive AR/VR applications, the importance of efficient and effective Neural Network (NN) models is undeniable, since missing body parts that cannot be captured by limited sensors should be generated using these models for a complete 3D full-body reconstruction in virtual environment. However, the state-of-the-art NN-models are typically computational expensive and they leverage longer sequences of sparse tracking inputs to generate full-body movements by capturing temporal context. Inevitably, longer sequences increase the computation overhead and introduce noise in longer temporal dependencies that adversely affect the generation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based method that enhances the overall performance while balancing the computational cost and memory overhead for efficient 3D full-body generation. Precisely, we introduce a NN-mechanism that divides the longer sequence of inputs into smaller temporal windows. Later, the current motion is merged with the information from these windows through latent representations to utilize the past context for the generation. Our experiments demonstrate that generation accuracy of our method with this NN-mechanism is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods while greatly reducing computational costs and memory overhead, making our method suitable for resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPRW2025 - 4D Vision Workshop</p></details> |
| **[TEMPURA: Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01583v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal segmentation leads to improved video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIDSTAMP: A Temporally-Aware Watermark for Ownership and Integrity in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01406v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of video diffusion models has enabled the generation of highly realistic and temporally coherent videos, raising critical concerns about content authenticity, provenance, and misuse. Existing watermarking approaches, whether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often struggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion, dropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we introduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or per-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video diffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage pipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation, and then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency, VIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions and temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and offers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining comparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds 768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a log P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score of 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior methods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

| **[Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01361v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRAVELER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Temporal Reasoning across Vague, Implicit and Explicit References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01325v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and resolving temporal references is essential in Natural Language Understanding as we often refer to the past or future in daily communication. Although existing benchmarks address a system's ability to reason about and resolve temporal references, systematic evaluation of specific temporal references remains limited. Towards closing this gap, we introduce TRAVELER, a novel synthetic benchmark dataset that follows a Question Answering paradigm and consists of questions involving temporal references with the corresponding correct answers. TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve explicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references. Beyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the type of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance in relation to the length of the set of events. For the category of vague temporal references, ground-truth answers were established via human surveys on Prolific, following a procedure similar to the one from Kenneweg et al. To demonstrate the benchmark's applicability, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs using a question-answering task encompassing 3,300 questions. Our findings show that while the benchmarked LLMs can answer questions over event sets with a handful of events and explicit temporal references successfully, performance clearly deteriorates with larger event set length and when temporal references get less explicit. Notably, the vague question category exhibits the lowest performance across all models.

In this paper, we introduce a factorized model that captures the semantics of these adverbials as probabilistic distributions. These distributions are composed with event-specific distributions to yield a contextualized meaning for an adverbial applied to a specific event. We fit the model's parameters using existing data capturing judgments of native speakers regarding the applicability of these vague temporal adverbials to events that took place a given time ago. Comparing our approach to a non-factorized model based on a single Gaussian distribution for each pair of event and temporal adverbial, we find that while both models have similar predictive power, our model is preferable in terms of Occam's razor, as it is simpler and has better extendability.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin comment: This version has been removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission</p></details> |
| **[3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial Graph Order Attention and Temporal Body Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01003v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are the prevailing techniques for 3D human pose estimation. However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/Massive-STEPS</p></details> |  |

The algorithm estimates Markov parameters from a single trajectory and applies a variant of the Ho-Kalman algorithm to recover the system matrices.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finite-sample bound for this algorithm in the single-trajectory setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active RLHF via Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 16 figures |

When motors saturate in quadrotor systems, there is an ``uncontrolled drift" of the vehicle that results in a crash. To tackle saturation, we apply a control decomposition and learn a tracking penalty from simulation data consisting of low, medium and high-cost reference trajectories. Our approach reduces crash rates by around $49\%$ compared to baselines on aggressive maneuvers in simulation. On the Crazyflie hardware platform, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments that lead to successful flights. Motivated by the growing interest in data-driven methods to quadrotor planning, we provide open-source lightweight code with an easy-to-use abstraction of hardware platforms.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: \textbf{(1) Lack of functions to express intent}, \textbf{(2) Inefficient action sequences}, and \textbf{(3) Incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task}. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three types of misalignments. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect these misalignments in O2ARC trajectories and conduct a hierarchical and quantitative analysis of their impact. Furthermore, we introduce an intention estimation algorithm that predicts missing alignment information between user actions and inferred intentions, leveraging our formalized framework. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the potential of intention learning.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |

Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while maintaining anatomical consistency, MambaControl combines Mamba-based long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity, highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning.

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications, July 28-30th, 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v4)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of GPS trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped GPS locations. Such data is widely used for various tasks such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. A universal vehicle trajectory model could be applied to different tasks, removing the need to maintain multiple specialized models, thereby reducing computational and storage costs. However, creating such a model is challenging when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised, i.e., in scenarios where only partial features are available or the trajectories are sparse. To address these challenges, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM), which can effectively adapt to different tasks without excessive retraining. UVTM incorporates two specialized designs. First, it divides trajectory features into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to accommodate tasks with only partially available features. Second, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing dense, feature-complete trajectories from sparse, feature-incomplete counterparts, enabling strong performance even when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised. Experiments involving four representative trajectory-related tasks on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the performance of UVTM and offer evidence that it is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for 3D Reconstruction from Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of generating an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. Most importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), specifically, an orbit of camera views, which maximizes the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which in turn, are passed to a multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final reconstruction. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying the pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA on the unseen GSO dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning.

Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.</p></details> |  |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08680v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships.

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Realistic Adversarial Attacks for Robustness Evaluation of Trajectory Prediction Models via Future State Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06134v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems, enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users. Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of model performance in real-world conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors, enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedTDP: A Privacy-Preserving and Unified Framework for Trajectory Data Preparation via Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05155v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Predictable and Robust Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04193v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems.

The formulation extends the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. A tailored genetic algorithm evolves candidate solutions using a fitness function, crossover, and mutation, with constraint enforcement via a penalty method. Differential flatness and clothoid curves are employed to penalize infeasible trajectories efficiently, while the Euler spiral method ensures curvature-continuous trajectories with bounded curvature, enhancing dynamic feasibility and mitigating oscillations typical of minimum-jerk and snap parameterizations. Due to the discrete variable length optimization space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. The algorithm's performance is validated through simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped, supported by benchmarking and time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Riemannian Direct Trajectory Optimization of Rigid Bodies on Matrix Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02323v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v4)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation.

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting.

Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving trajectory continuity in drone-based crowd monitoring using a set of minimal-cost techniques and deep discriminative correlation filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20234v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based crowd monitoring is the key technology for applications in surveillance, public safety, and event management. However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Trajectory Following with STELA: Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation & Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20009v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation and control are often addressed separately, leading to unsafe execution due to sensing noise, execution errors, and discrepancies between the planning model and reality. Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods. The code is developed in C++ with python interface, and available at https://github.com/IRMV-Manipulation-Group/UTTG.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19007v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Longitudinal Trajectory Dataset for Automated Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00009v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Vehicles (AVs) promise significant advances in transportation. Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), JCluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation.

| **[Active RLHF via Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[VL-TGS: Trajectory Generation and Selection using Vision Language Models in Mapless Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02454v6)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-modal trajectory generation and selection algorithm for real-world mapless outdoor navigation in human-centered environments. Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 16 figures |

When motors saturate in quadrotor systems, there is an ``uncontrolled drift" of the vehicle that results in a crash. To tackle saturation, we apply a control decomposition and learn a tracking penalty from simulation data consisting of low, medium and high-cost reference trajectories. Our approach reduces crash rates by around $49\%$ compared to baselines on aggressive maneuvers in simulation. On the Crazyflie hardware platform, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments that lead to successful flights. Motivated by the growing interest in data-driven methods to quadrotor planning, we provide open-source lightweight code with an easy-to-use abstraction of hardware platforms.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: \textbf{(1) Lack of functions to express intent}, \textbf{(2) Inefficient action sequences}, and \textbf{(3) Incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task}. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three types of misalignments. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect these misalignments in O2ARC trajectories and conduct a hierarchical and quantitative analysis of their impact. Furthermore, we introduce an intention estimation algorithm that predicts missing alignment information between user actions and inferred intentions, leveraging our formalized framework. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the potential of intention learning.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |

Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while maintaining anatomical consistency, MambaControl combines Mamba-based long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity, highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  |

The encoded scene information serves as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. To tackle the mode collapse dilemma in generating high-quality diverse trajectories, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the training process.TransDiffuser achieves PDMS of 94.85 on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods without any anchor-based prior trajectories.</p></details> | Under review |

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications, July 28-30th, 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

Such data is widely used for various tasks such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. A universal vehicle trajectory model could be applied to different tasks, removing the need to maintain multiple specialized models, thereby reducing computational and storage costs. However, creating such a model is challenging when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised, i.e., in scenarios where only partial features are available or the trajectories are sparse. To address these challenges, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM), which can effectively adapt to different tasks without excessive retraining. UVTM incorporates two specialized designs. First, it divides trajectory features into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to accommodate tasks with only partially available features. Second, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing dense, feature-complete trajectories from sparse, feature-incomplete counterparts, enabling strong performance even when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised. Experiments involving four representative trajectory-related tasks on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the performance of UVTM and offer evidence that it is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for 3D Reconstruction from Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of generating an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. Most importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), specifically, an orbit of camera views, which maximizes the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which in turn, are passed to a multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final reconstruction. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying the pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA on the unseen GSO dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors.

Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SICNav-Diffusion: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation with Diffusion Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08858v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08680v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations.

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Patterns: Harnessing Causal Logic for Autonomous Driving Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06856v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction has long been a major challenge for autonomous driving (AD). Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v3)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Barrier-Enhanced Parallel Homotopic Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10441v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Realistic Adversarial Attacks for Robustness Evaluation of Trajectory Prediction Models via Future State Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06134v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems, enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users. Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of model performance in real-world conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors, enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedTDP: A Privacy-Preserving and Unified Framework for Trajectory Data Preparation via Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05155v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

| **[Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Predictable and Robust Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04193v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

The formulation extends the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. A tailored genetic algorithm evolves candidate solutions using a fitness function, crossover, and mutation, with constraint enforcement via a penalty method. Differential flatness and clothoid curves are employed to penalize infeasible trajectories efficiently, while the Euler spiral method ensures curvature-continuous trajectories with bounded curvature, enhancing dynamic feasibility and mitigating oscillations typical of minimum-jerk and snap parameterizations. Due to the discrete variable length optimization space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. The algorithm's performance is validated through simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped, supported by benchmarking and time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Trajectory Prediction of Vessels for Inland Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00599v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and remote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory prediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and human operators in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, updated results</p></details> |

Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling.

| **[Improving trajectory continuity in drone-based crowd monitoring using a set of minimal-cost techniques and deep discriminative correlation filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20234v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based crowd monitoring is the key technology for applications in surveillance, public safety, and event management. However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Trajectory Following with STELA: Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation & Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20009v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation and control are often addressed separately, leading to unsafe execution due to sensing noise, execution errors, and discrepancies between the planning model and reality. Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods.

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention.

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Transferable text data distillation by trajectory matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09818v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of large language model (LLM), as the size of large models increases, it also brings higher training costs. There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improving Assembly Code Performance with Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HumaniBench, a holistic benchmark of 32K real-world image question pairs, annotated via a scalable GPT4o assisted pipeline and exhaustively verified by domain experts. HumaniBench evaluates seven Human Centered AI (HCAI) principles: fairness, ethics, understanding, reasoning, language inclusivity, empathy, and robustness, across seven diverse tasks, including open and closed ended visual question answering (VQA), multilingual QA, visual grounding, empathetic captioning, and robustness tests. Benchmarking 15 state of the art LMMs (open and closed source) reveals that proprietary models generally lead, though robustness and visual grounding remain weak points. Some open-source models also struggle to balance accuracy with adherence to human-aligned principles. HumaniBench is the first benchmark purpose built around HCAI principles. It provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing alignment gaps and guiding LMMs toward behavior that is both accurate and socially responsible. Dataset, annotation prompts, and evaluation code are available at: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/HumaniBench</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTextVQA: A Large-Scale Visual Question Answering Dataset for Evaluating Vietnamese Text Comprehension in Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10652v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Question Answerinng (VQA) is a complicated task that requires the capability of simultaneously processing natural language and images. This task was initially researched with a focus on developing methods to help machines understand objects and scene contexts in images. However, some scene text that carries explicit information about the full content of the image is not mentioned. Along with the continuous development of the AI era, there have been many studies on the reading comprehension ability of VQA models in the world. Therefore, we introduce the first large-scale dataset in Vietnamese specializing in the ability to understand scene text, we call it ViTextVQA (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Text}-based \textbf{V}isual \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering dataset) which contains \textbf{over 16,000} images and \textbf{over 50,000} questions with answers. To tackle this task efficiently, we propose ViTextBLIP-2, an novel multimodal feature fusion Method, which optimizes Vietnamese OCR-based VQA by integrating a frozen Vision Transformer, SwinTextSpotter OCR, and ViT5 LLM with a trainable Q-Former for multimodal feature fusion. Through experiments with various state-of-the-art models, we uncover the significance of the order in which tokens in OCR text are processed and selected to formulate answers. This finding helped us significantly improve the performance of the baseline models on the ViTextVQA dataset. Our dataset is available (https://github.com/minhquan6203/ViTextVQA-Dataset) for research purposes.</p></details> |  |

Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity.

MoE emerges as a promising architecture to scale large language models (LLMs) to unprecedented sizes, thereby enhancing model performance. However, existing MoE training systems experience a degradation in training efficiency, exacerbated by the escalating scale of MoE models and the continuous evolution of hardware. Recognizing the pivotal role of efficient communication in enhancing MoE training, MegaScale-MoE customizes communication-efficient parallelism strategies for attention and FFNs in each MoE layer and adopts a holistic approach to overlap communication with computation at both inter- and intra-operator levels. Additionally, MegaScale-MoE applies communication compression with adjusted communication patterns to lower precision, further improving training efficiency. When training a 352B MoE model on 1,440 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, MegaScale-MoE achieves a training throughput of 1.41M tokens/s, improving the efficiency by 1.88$\times$ compared to Megatron-LM. We share our operational experience in accelerating MoE training and hope that by offering our insights in system design, this work will motivate future research in MoE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmotionHallucer: Evaluating Emotion Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11405v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations, generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation, we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct, these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected models. Resources will be available at https://github.com/xxtars/EmotionHallucer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phare: A Safety Probe for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11365v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EIAD: Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Via Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14162v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical to ensure product quality during manufacturing. Although existing zero-shot defect segmentation and detection methods have shown effectiveness, they cannot provide detailed descriptions of the defects. Furthermore, the application of large multi-modal models in IAD remains in its infancy, facing challenges in balancing question-answering (QA) performance and mask-based grounding capabilities, often owing to overfitting during the fine-tuning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that introduces a dedicated multi-modal defect localization module to decouple the dialog functionality from the core feature extraction. This decoupling is achieved through independent optimization objectives and tailored learning strategies. Additionally, we contribute to the first multi-modal industrial anomaly detection training dataset, named Defect Detection Question Answering (DDQA), encompassing a wide range of defect types and industrial scenarios. Unlike conventional datasets that rely on GPT-generated data, DDQA ensures authenticity and reliability and offers a robust foundation for model training. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Assistant (EIAD), achieves outstanding performance in defect detection and localization tasks. It not only significantly enhances accuracy but also improves interpretability. These advancements highlight the potential of EIAD for practical applications in industrial settings.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |

Despite growing interest in this area, progress has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets and automatic evaluation standards. This work presents a comprehensive approach to support the development and benchmarking of systems for this task. We construct the first large-scale manually-annotated dataset. We also investigate automatic evaluation methods and identify a reference-based technique using large language models (LLMs) as the strategy that best correlates with human judgments. Our zero-shot evaluation of 11 LLMs establishes a strong baseline while showcasing the difficulty of the task. Data, code, and a public leaderboard are provided to encourage further research not only in terms of model performance, but also to explore the practical benefits of CQs-Gen for both automated reasoning and human critical thinking.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAGON: A Large-Scale Dataset of Realistic Images Generated by Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11257v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable ease of use of diffusion models for image generation has led to a proliferation of synthetic content online. While these models are often employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test set, intended to serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of newly developed methods.</p></details> |  |

Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary moderation approaches, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for harm mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, due to patient data privacy concerns and computational costs, many healthcare providers prefer using small, locally-hosted models over external generic LLMs. This study presents a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the open-source LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model, enabling it to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. In the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness than physician-authored notes (4.1/5). We highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format, rather than relying on LLMs to determine this for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

However, their large parameters make real-world deployment resource-intensive and often impractical for constrained systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for task-specific agents but suffers from high sample complexity, limiting practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce LVLM to Policy (LVLM2P), a novel framework that distills knowledge from large vision-language models (LVLM) into more efficient RL agents. Our approach leverages the LVLM as a teacher, providing instructional actions based on trajectories collected by the RL agent, which helps reduce less meaningful exploration in the early stages of learning, thereby significantly accelerating the agent's learning progress. Additionally, by leveraging the LVLM to suggest actions directly from visual observations, we eliminate the need for manual textual descriptors of the environment, enhancing applicability across diverse tasks. Experiments show that LVLM2P significantly enhances the sample efficiency of baseline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, ICASSP 2025.

Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies, and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles, context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool. The white-box ATT-Corpus and Auto-ATT can be found in ATT Hugging Face Collection (https://huggingface.co/collections/meituan/audio-turing-test-682446320368164faeaf38a4).</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[V-MAGE: A Game Evaluation Framework for Assessing Vision-Centric Capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06148v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual-text processing. However, existing static image-text benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating their dynamic perception and interactive reasoning abilities. We introduce Vision-centric Multiple Abilities Game Evaluation(V-MAGE), a novel game-based evaluation framework designed to systematically assess MLLMs' visual reasoning in interactive, continuous-space environments. V-MAGE features five distinct video games comprising over 30 carefully constructed evaluation scenarios. These scenarios are set in free-form, visually complex environments that require models to interpret dynamic game states and make decisions based solely on visual input, thereby closely reflecting the conditions encountered by human players. To ensure robust and interpretable comparisons across models, V-MAGE employs a dynamic Elo-based ranking system that accounts for varying difficulty levels and task diversity. Benchmarking state-of-the-art MLLMs against human baselines reveals that while leading models approach human-level performance in simple tasks, their performance drops significantly in complex scenarios requiring advanced reasoning and task orchestration. This persistent performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform real-time, vision-grounded interactions. Through extensive analyses, we demonstrate the utility of V-MAGE in uncovering these limitations and providing actionable insights for improving the visual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in dynamic, interactive settings. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/V-MAGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Reasoning can Improve Factuality in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11140v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities have demonstrated promising improvements in model performance by leveraging a lengthy thinking process and additional computational resources during inference, primarily in tasks involving mathematical reasoning (Muennighoff et al., 2025). However, it remains uncertain if longer reasoning chains inherently enhance factual accuracy, particularly beyond mathematical contexts. In this work, we thoroughly examine LLM reasoning within complex open-domain question-answering (QA) scenarios. We initially distill reasoning traces from advanced, large-scale reasoning models (QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1-671B), then fine-tune a variety of models ranging from smaller, instruction-tuned variants to larger architectures based on Qwen2.5. To enrich reasoning traces, we introduce factual information from knowledge graphs in the form of paths into our reasoning traces. Our experimental setup includes four baseline approaches and six different instruction-tuned models evaluated across a benchmark of six datasets, encompassing over 22.6K questions. Overall, we carry out 168 experimental runs and analyze approximately 1.7 million reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that, within a single run, smaller reasoning models achieve noticeable improvements in factual accuracy compared to their original instruction-tuned counterparts. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that adding test-time compute and token budgets factual accuracy consistently improves by 2-8%, further confirming the effectiveness of test-time scaling for enhancing performance and consequently improving reasoning accuracy in open-domain QA tasks. We release all the experimental artifacts for further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Attractor Cycles in Large Language Models: A Dynamical Systems View of Successive Paraphrasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15208v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems theory provides a framework for analyzing iterative processes and evolution over time. Within such systems, repetitive transformations can lead to stable configurations, known as attractors, including fixed points and limit cycles. Applying this perspective to large language models (LLMs), which iteratively map input text to output text, provides a principled approach to characterizing long-term behaviors. Successive paraphrasing serves as a compelling testbed for exploring such dynamics, as paraphrases re-express the same underlying meaning with linguistic variation. Although LLMs are expected to explore a diverse set of paraphrases in the text space, our study reveals that successive paraphrasing converges to stable periodic states, such as 2-period attractor cycles, limiting linguistic diversity. This phenomenon is attributed to the self-reinforcing nature of LLMs, as they iteratively favour and amplify certain textual forms over others. This pattern persists with increasing generation randomness or alternating prompts and LLMs. These findings underscore inherent constraints in LLM generative capability, while offering a novel dynamical systems perspective for studying their expressive potential.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Pathology Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy in pathology image analysis. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490K samples from diverse pathology tasks, we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

Given that audio large language models (ALLMs) have made significant progress in various audio processing tasks, a heuristic question arises: Can ALLMs be leveraged to solve ADD?. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of ALLMs on ADD, revealing their ineffectiveness in detecting fake audio. To enhance their performance, we propose $\mathcal{A}LLM4ADD$, an ALLM-driven framework for ADD. Specifically, we reformulate ADD task as an audio question answering problem, prompting the model with the question: "Is this audio fake or real?". We then perform supervised fine-tuning to enable the ALLM to assess the authenticity of query audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our ALLM-based method can achieve superior performance in fake audio detection, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. As a pioneering study, we anticipate that this work will inspire the research community to leverage ALLMs to develop more effective ADD systems.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel insights into diverse watermarking paradigms.

To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of LLMs' ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' proficiency in handling ontologies -- formal, symbolic representations of domain knowledge through concepts, relationships, and instances. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 58,981 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing proficiency in understanding ontological knowledge but substantial weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in LLMs' capability to process symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to NeruoIPS 2025 dataset and benchmark track</p></details> |

While Transformer-based methods effectively capture global dependencies, they often overlook short-term local variations in time series. Recent methods that adapt large language models (LLMs) into time series forecasting inherit this limitation by treating LLMs as black-box encoders, relying solely on the final-layer output and underutilizing hierarchical representations. To address this limitation, we propose Logo-LLM, a novel LLM-based framework that explicitly extracts and models multi-scale temporal features from different layers of a pre-trained LLM. Through empirical analysis, we show that shallow layers of LLMs capture local dynamics in time series, while deeper layers encode global trends. Moreover, Logo-LLM introduces lightweight Local-Mixer and Global-Mixer modules to align and integrate features with the temporal input across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Logo-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks, with strong generalization in few-shot and zero-shot settings while maintaining low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review-Instruct: A Review-Driven Multi-Turn Conversations Generation Method for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11010v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative "Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty. We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\% on MT-Bench compared to prior state-of-the-art models based on LLaMA2-13B. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the Review stage and the use of multiple Reviewers in boosting instruction diversity and difficulty. Our work highlights the potential of review-driven, multi-agent frameworks for generating high-quality conversational data at scale.</p></details> | ACL2025 Accepted |

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding.

Current benchmarks largely overlook this critical challenge. We introduce Multi-View Multi-Illumination Anomaly Detection (M2AD), a new large-scale benchmark comprising 119,880 high-resolution images designed explicitly to probe VAD robustness under such interacting conditions. By systematically capturing 999 specimens across 10 categories using 12 synchronized views and 10 illumination settings (120 configurations total), M2AD enables rigorous evaluation. We establish two evaluation protocols: M2AD-Synergy tests the ability to fuse information across diverse configurations, and M2AD-Invariant measures single-image robustness against realistic view-illumination effects. Our extensive benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art VAD methods struggle significantly on M2AD, demonstrating the profound challenge posed by view-illumination interplay. This benchmark serves as an essential tool for developing and validating VAD methods capable of overcoming real-world complexities. Our full dataset and test suite will be released at https://hustcyq.github.io/M2AD to facilitate the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homge...</summary><p>Homgepage: https://hustcyq.github.io/M2AD/.

These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates, limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a large reasoning transformer-based criticmodel scaling scheme that brings reasoning ability into DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks.</p></details> |  |

The dataset includes captions generated by a state-of-the-art captioning model, enhanced with imputed metadata. We also introduce a retrieval system that leverages both musical features and metadata to identify similar songs, which are then used to fill in missing metadata using a local large language model (LLLM). This approach allows us to provide a more comprehensive and informative dataset for researchers working on music-language understanding tasks. We validate this approach quantitatively with five different measurements. By making the JamendoMaxCaps dataset publicly available, we provide a high-quality resource to advance research in music-language understanding tasks such as music retrieval, multimodal representation learning, and generative music models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.06118</p></details> |

Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

These models leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, enabling them to emulate human-like reasoning strategies. However, the advancement of LRMs is hindered by the lack of comprehensive CoT datasets. Current resources often fail to provide extensive reasoning problems with coherent CoT processes distilled from multiple teacher models and do not account for multifaceted properties describing the internal characteristics of CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniThought, a large-scale dataset featuring 2 million CoT processes generated and validated by two powerful LRMs as teacher models. Each CoT process in OmniThought is annotated with novel Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores, which describe the appropriateness of CoT verbosity and cognitive difficulty level for models to comprehend these reasoning processes. We further establish a self-reliant pipeline to curate this dataset. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5 models of various sizes demonstrate the positive impact of our proposed scores on LRM training effectiveness. Based on the proposed OmniThought dataset, we further train and release a series of high-performing LRMs, specifically equipped with stronger reasoning abilities and optimal CoT output length and difficulty level. Our contributions significantly enhance the development and training of LRMs for solving complex tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Effective Label-free Node Classification in Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11983v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Locle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node Classification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.

While instructions have been widely used as the guidelines for task solving, this paper further notices that both instructions and parameters are the compression of task data. Therefore, they could be strongly correlated and can be learned to predict one from the other. This paper proposes a novel neural network framework, SHIP (\textbf{Sh}uttle between the \textbf{I}nstructions and the \textbf{P}arameters), to model and learn the mutual mappings between the instructions and the parameters of LLMs. We verify that SHIP can effectively map one of the instructions/parameters to the other by evaluating it on the tasks of instruction deduction and induction. The results show that SHIP performs better than existing baseline methods in terms of deductive capabilities while significantly surpassing them in inductive capabilities. Moreover, SHIP can effectively combine the two mapping processes to perform excellent inductive reasoning. The code and data for this paper are released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Shuttle-Between-Instructions-Parameters/.</p></details> |  |

We present SOLAR (Scalable Optimization of Large-scale Architecture for Reasoning), a framework that dynamically optimizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) topologies to boost accuracy and efficiency. Our Topological-Annotation-Generation (TAG) system automates dataset creation, annotation, and difficulty segmentation, leading to stronger post training and test-time performance. We also propose Topological-Scaling, a curriculum-learning-based approach that adaptively combines post training and inference scaling to each task. On MATH and GSM8K, SOLAR delivers notable gains: +5% accuracy with Topological Tuning, +9% with Topological Rewarding, and +10.02% with Hybrid Scaling, while reducing response length by over 5%, lowering inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce a multi-task Topological Reward Model (M-TRM) that selects both the optimal reasoning topology and final answer in a single pass, eliminating multiple single-task TRMs. Remarkably, M-TRM also surpasses all single-task TRMs, improving accuracy by +10% and rank correlation by +9%. Overall, SOLAR establishes a new benchmark for scalable, high-precision LLM reasoning and introduces a fully automated, dynamic topology competition mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods like data mixture strategies face limitations, including heavy reliance on expert knowledge and conflicting optimization signals. While model merging offers parameter-level conflict-resolution strategies through integrating specialized models' parameters, its potential for 3H optimization remains underexplored. This paper systematically compares the effectiveness of model merging and data mixture methods in constructing 3H-aligned LLMs for the first time, revealing previously overlooked collaborative and conflict relationships among the 3H dimensions and discussing the advantages and drawbacks of data mixture (\textit{data-level}) and model merging (\textit{parameter-level}) methods in mitigating the conflict for balanced 3H optimization. Specially, we propose a novel \textbf{R}eweighting \textbf{E}nhanced task \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{M}erging method, \textbf{RESM}, through outlier weighting and sparsity-aware rank selection strategies to address the challenges of preference noise accumulation and layer sparsity adaptation inherent in 3H-aligned LLM merging. Extensive evaluations can verify the effectiveness and robustness of RESM compared to previous data mixture (2\%-5\% gain) and model merging (1\%-3\% gain) methods in achieving balanced LLM alignment. We release our models through \href{https://huggingface.co/Jinluan}{3H\_Merging} for further investigations.</p></details> |  |

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. Also, existing DRL-based user association methods are typically applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce a large vision model (LVM)-enhanced digital twin (DT) for wireless networks and propose a parallel DT-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. To construct this LVM-enhanced DT for DRL training, we develop a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on the diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. DRL models undergo training in the DT environment, avoiding direct interactions with physical networks. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve training efficiency. Numerical results show that the developed LVM-enhanced DT achieves closely comparable training efficacy to the real environment, and the proposed parallel DT framework even outperforms the single real-world environment in DRL training with nearly 20\% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.19765.

At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better.

At its core, AutoRAN leverages a weak, less-aligned reasoning model to simulate the target model's high-level reasoning structures, generates narrative prompts, and iteratively refines candidate prompts by incorporating the target model's intermediate reasoning steps. We evaluate AutoRAN against state-of-the-art LRMs including GPT-o3/o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash across multiple benchmark datasets (AdvBench, HarmBench, and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that AutoRAN achieves remarkable success rates (approaching 100%) within one or a few turns across different LRMs, even when judged by a robustly aligned external model. This work reveals that leveraging weak reasoning models can effectively exploit the critical vulnerabilities of much more capable reasoning models, highlighting the need for improved safety measures specifically designed for reasoning-based models.

Using Brainteasers as a Window into the Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10844v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use. Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2) generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | 13 Tables; 5 Figures |

However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges due to high memory demands and significant communication overhead in distributed settings. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate computation load to some extent but often fail to address communication inefficiencies inherent in distributed environments. This paper presents RapidGNN that introduces a deterministic sampling strategy to precompute mini-batches. By leveraging the sampling strategy, RapidGNN accurately anticipates feature access patterns, enabling optimal cache construction and timely prefetching of remote features. This reduces the frequency and latency of remote data transfers without compromising the stochastic nature of training. Evaluations on Reddit and OGBN-Products datasets demonstrate that RapidGNN achieves significant reductions in training time and remote feature fetches, outperforming existing models in both communication efficiency and throughput. Our findings highlight RapidGNN's potential for scalable, high-performance GNN training across large, real-world graph datasets along with improving energy efficiency. Our model improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.10x on average over SOTA model GraphSAGE-METIS (up to 2.45x in some settings), while cutting remote feature fetches by over 4x. It also reduces energy consumption up to 23%.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamicRAG: Leveraging Outputs of Large Language Model as Feedback for Dynamic Reranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07233v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, making them highly effective for knowledge-intensive tasks. A crucial but often under-explored component of these systems is the reranker. Since irrelevant documents in RAG systems can mislead the generator, the reranker plays a vital role in refining retrieved documents to enhance generation quality and explainability. However, it is challenging to determine the appropriate number of documents ($k$) that the reranker should select: too few may result in missing critical information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results among models of same parameter sizes. The model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/DynamicRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single multi-task model, introduces a novel risk of unauthorized use of LLMs due to its efficient merging process. While fingerprinting techniques have been proposed for verifying model ownership, their resistance to model merging remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method, MergePrint, which embeds robust fingerprints capable of surviving model merging. MergePrint enables black-box ownership verification, where owners only need to check if a model produces target outputs for specific fingerprint inputs, without accessing model weights or intermediate outputs. By optimizing against a pseudo-merged model that simulates merged behavior, MergePrint ensures fingerprints that remain detectable after merging. Additionally, to minimize performance degradation, we pre-optimize the fingerprint inputs. MergePrint pioneers a practical solution for black-box ownership verification, protecting LLMs from misappropriation via merging, while also excelling in resistance to broader model theft threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Ranked Voting based Self-Consistency of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10772v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majority voting is considered an effective method to enhance chain-of-thought reasoning, as it selects the answer with the highest "self-consistency" among different reasoning paths (Wang et al., 2023). However, previous chain-of-thought reasoning methods typically generate only a single answer in each trial, thereby ignoring the possibility of other potential answers. As a result, these alternative answers are often overlooked in subsequent voting processes. In this work, we propose to generate ranked answers in each reasoning process and conduct ranked voting among multiple ranked answers from different responses, thereby making the overall self-consistency more reliable. Specifically, we use three ranked voting methods: Instant-runoff voting, Borda count voting, and mean reciprocal rank voting. We validate our methods on six datasets, including three multiple-choice and three open-ended question-answering tasks, using both advanced open-source and closed-source large language models. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the baselines, showcasing the potential of leveraging the information of ranked answers and using ranked voting to improve reasoning performance. The code is available at https://github.com/szu-tera/RankedVotingSC.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

Although several foundation models for biomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on certain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen domain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before segmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us to leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling vision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose using MLLMs to guide SAM in learning microscopy crose-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy, named uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment (VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find that after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves significantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception. Therefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to prompt SAM. Our method achieves performance improvements of 7.71% in Dice and 12.10% in SA across 9 in-domain microscopy datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our method also demonstrates improvements of 6.79% in Dice and 10.08% in SA across 10 out-ofdomain datasets, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ieellee/uLLSAM.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SecReEvalBench: A Multi-turned Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07584v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of large language models in security-sensitive domains necessitates rigorous evaluation of their resilience against adversarial prompt-based attacks. While previous benchmarks have focused on security evaluations with limited and predefined attack domains, such as cybersecurity attacks, they often lack a comprehensive assessment of intent-driven adversarial prompts and the consideration of real-life scenario-based multi-turn attacks. To address this gap, we present SecReEvalBench, the Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark, which defines four novel metrics: Prompt Attack Resilience Score, Prompt Attack Refusal Logic Score, Chain-Based Attack Resilience Score and Chain-Based Attack Rejection Time Score. Moreover, SecReEvalBench employs six questioning sequences for model assessment: one-off attack, successive attack, successive reverse attack, alternative attack, sequential ascending attack with escalating threat levels and sequential descending attack with diminishing threat levels. In addition, we introduce a dataset customized for the benchmark, which incorporates both neutral and malicious prompts, categorised across seven security domains and sixteen attack techniques. In applying this benchmark, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art open-weighted large language models, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Mistral v0.3, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen 3. Our findings offer critical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of modern large language models in defending against evolving adversarial threats. The SecReEvalBench dataset is publicly available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/5a7ee22cf9dab6c93b55a73f630f6c9b42e936351b0ae98fbae6ddaca7fe248d, which provides a groundwork for advancing research in large language model security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Enhancers for Graph Neural Networks: An Analysis from the Perspective of Causal Mechanism Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08265v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) as feature enhancers to optimize node representations, which are then used as inputs for graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown significant potential in graph representation learning. However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results, we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets and models validate the proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Code-Driven Planning in Grid Worlds with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10749v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an iterative programmatic planning (IPP) framework for solving grid-based tasks by synthesizing interpretable agent policies expressed in code using large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on traditional search or reinforcement learning, our approach uses code generation as policy synthesis, where the LLM outputs executable programs that map environment states to action sequences. Our proposed architecture incorporates several prompting strategies, including direct code generation, pseudocode-conditioned refinement, and curriculum-based prompting, but also includes an iterative refinement mechanism that updates code based on task performance feedback. We evaluate our approach using six leading LLMs and two challenging grid-based benchmarks (GRASP and MiniGrid). Our IPP framework demonstrates improvements over direct code generation ranging from 10\% to as much as 10x across five of the six models and establishes a new state-of-the-art result for GRASP. IPP is found to significantly outperform direct elicitation of a solution from GPT-o3-mini (by 63\% on MiniGrid to 116\% on GRASP), demonstrating the viability of the overall approach. Computational costs of all code generation approaches are similar. While code generation has a higher initial prompting cost compared to direct solution elicitation (\$0.08 per task vs. \$0.002 per instance for GPT-o3-mini), the code can be reused for any number of instances, making the amortized cost significantly lower (by 400x on GPT-o3-mini across the complete GRASP benchmark).</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Security Audit Using Large Language Model based Agent: An Exploration Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10732v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current rapidly changing digital environment, businesses are under constant stress to ensure that their systems are secured. Security audits help to maintain a strong security posture by ensuring that policies are in place, controls are implemented, gaps are identified for cybersecurity risks mitigation. However, audits are usually manual, requiring much time and costs. This paper looks at the possibility of developing a framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as an autonomous agent to execute part of the security audit, namely with the field audit. password policy compliance for Windows operating system. Through the conduct of an exploration experiment of using GPT-4 with Langchain, the agent executed the audit tasks by accurately flagging password policy violations and appeared to be more efficient than traditional manual audits. Despite its potential limitations in operational consistency in complex and dynamic environment, the framework suggests possibilities to extend further to real-time threat monitoring and compliance checks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Model-Based Search Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00745v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.</p></details> |  |
| **[AD-LLM: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11142v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.</p></details> |  |

This dataset, collected in various photorealistic simulation environments includes multiple RGB stereo cameras for 360-degree coverage, along with depth, optical flow, stereo disparity, LiDAR point clouds, ground truth poses, semantic segmented images, and occupancy maps with semantic labels. Data is collected using an integrated automatic pipeline, which generates trajectories mimicking the motion patterns of various ground robot platforms, including wheeled and legged robots. We collect 910 trajectories across 70 environments, resulting in 1.5 million samples. Evaluations on occupancy prediction and SLAM tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. TartanGround can serve as a testbed for training and evaluation of a broad range of learning-based tasks, including occupancy prediction, SLAM, neural scene representation, perception-based navigation, and more, enabling advancements in robotic perception and autonomy towards achieving robust models generalizable to more diverse scenarios.

| **[Mitigate Language Priors in Large Vision-Language Models by Cross-Images Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10634v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language priors constitute one of the primary causes of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driving the models to generate linguistically plausible yet visually inconsistent content. The language priors in LVLMs originate from the linguistic knowledge inherited from their pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) backbone. Consequently, this characteristic is an intrinsic property of the model that remains independent of visual inputs. Inspired by the finding that language priors are consistent across images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method to alleviate language priors in LVLMs. CICD first identifies essential and detrimental priors, and then employs contrastive decoding to eliminate the detrimental ones. This approach simultaneously prevents LVLMs from generating hallucinated content while maintaining textual fluency and coherence. Furthermore, the limited information overlap between images helps prevent visual information loss during contrastive decoding. We validate the effectiveness of CICD on four benchmarks with six LVLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that CICD performs remarkably well in mitigating language priors, especially in the image captioning task, where such priors are most pronounced. Code will be released once accepted.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Neural Thermodynamic Laws (NTL) -- a new framework that offers fresh insights into LLM training dynamics. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that key thermodynamic quantities (e.g., temperature, entropy, heat capacity, thermal conduction) and classical thermodynamic principles (e.g., the three laws of thermodynamics and the equipartition theorem) naturally emerge under river-valley loss landscape assumptions. On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields intuitive guidelines for designing learning rate schedules.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10554v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

| **[Towards a Deeper Understanding of Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10543v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Enhancing the performance of LLMs in QA contexts is becoming increasingly vital for advancing their development and applicability. This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive, effective, and general QA solving method that explicitly incorporates three key steps: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Notably, this paper is the first to introduce intent analysis in QA, which plays a vital role in ARR. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 diverse QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently outperforms the baseline methods. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each ARR component. Furthermore, experiments involving variations in prompt design indicate that ARR maintains its effectiveness regardless of the specific prompt formulation. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Memory and Reasoning Ability in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13504v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in handling complex tasks requiring both extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. This ambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model performance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

Current code security benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive experiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization directions, offering insights for future research in LLM code security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Machine Learning with Applications, Author Contributions: Averi Bates: Methodology, Development, Analysis, Data Curation, Drafting, Review.

| **[Data-Driven Calibration of Prediction Sets in Large Vision-Language Models Based on Inductive Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17671v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICIPCA 2025</p></details> |

This study evaluates the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Approximate Biclique Counting over Large Bipartite Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10471v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet, it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts. Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Multiple Large Language Models: A Survey on LLM Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18036v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM Ensemble -- which involves the comprehensive use of multiple large language models (LLMs), each aimed at handling user queries during downstream inference, to benefit from their individual strengths -- has gained substantial attention recently. The widespread availability of LLMs, coupled with their varying strengths and out-of-the-box usability, has profoundly advanced the field of LLM Ensemble. This paper presents the first systematic review of recent developments in LLM Ensemble. First, we introduce our taxonomy of LLM Ensemble and discuss several related research problems. Then, we provide a more in-depth classification of the methods under the broad categories of "ensemble-before-inference, ensemble-during-inference, ensemble-after-inference'', and review all relevant methods. Finally, we introduce related benchmarks and applications, summarize existing studies, and suggest several future research directions.

| **[Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Tokenization Matters! Degrading Large Language Models through Challenging Their Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17067v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Nonetheless, it was also witnessed that LLMs tend to produce inaccurate responses to specific queries. This deficiency can be traced to the tokenization step LLMs must undergo, which is an inevitable limitation inherent to all LLMs. In fact, incorrect tokenization is the critical point that hinders LLMs in understanding the input precisely, thus leading to unsatisfactory output. This defect is more obvious in Chinese scenarios. To demonstrate this flaw of LLMs, we construct an adversarial dataset, named as $\textbf{ADT (Adversarial Dataset for Tokenizer)}$, which draws upon the vocabularies of various open-source LLMs to challenge LLMs' tokenization. ADT consists of two subsets: the manually constructed ADT-Human and the automatically generated ADT-Auto. Our empirical results reveal that our ADT is highly effective on challenging the tokenization of leading LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3, Deepseek-R1 and so on, thus degrading these LLMs' capabilities. Moreover, our method of automatic data generation has been proven efficient and robust, which can be applied to any open-source LLMs. In this paper, we substantially investigate LLMs' vulnerability in terms of challenging their token segmentation, which will shed light on the subsequent research of improving LLMs' capabilities through optimizing their tokenization process and algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are LLM-generated plain language summaries truly understandable? A large-scale crowdsourced evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10409v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness, coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations, human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore, automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to systematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and comprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods that explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Path Finding For Large Agents Is Intractable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10387v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem) to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path finding instance has a solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Awareness in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Fact Recall Across Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13338v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Who is the US President? The answer changes depending on when the question is asked. While large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on various reasoning tasks, they often miss a crucial dimension: time. In real-world scenarios, the correctness of answers is frequently tied to temporal context. To address this gap, we present a novel framework and dataset spanning over 8,000 events from 2018 to 2024, annotated with day-level granularity and sourced globally across domains such as politics, science, and business. Our TimeShift evaluation method systematically probes LLMs for temporal reasoning, revealing that base models often outperform instruction-tuned and synthetic-trained counterparts on time-sensitive recall. Additionally, we find that even large-scale models exhibit brittleness in handling paraphrased facts, highlighting unresolved challenges in temporal consistency. By identifying these limitations, our work provides a significant step toward advancing time-aware language models capable of adapting to the dynamic nature of real-world knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple and Provable Scaling Laws for the Test-Time Compute of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19477v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirically evaluating commonsense intelligence in large language models with large-scale human judgments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10309v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Questions to Clinical Recommendations: Large Language Models Driving Evidence-Based Clinical Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10282v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.</p></details> |  |

Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of the approaches in this relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This work systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods. We benchmark seven of them on public datasets and critically assess their comparability and the reproducibility of their reported results. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field, with insights on how to report results, which data sets, metrics and which terminology to use, and which inconsistencies to avoid, with code and results made publicly available for transparency.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 figures |

However, the differences between them across different medical tasks remain underexplored.

| **[VQ-Logits: Compressing the Output Bottleneck of Large Language Models via Vector Quantized Logits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10202v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but face significant computational and memory challenges, particularly due to their extensive output vocabularies. The final linear projection layer, mapping hidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial portion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference. Existing methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce structural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach that leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter count and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the large V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K embedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of these K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook, which are then efficiently "scattered" to the full vocabulary space using the learned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits can achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in logit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to full softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on codebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase Diagram of Vision Large Language Models Inference: A Perspective from Interaction across Image and Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00646v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) usually take input as a concatenation of image token embeddings and text token embeddings and conduct causal modeling. However, their internal behaviors remain underexplored, raising the question of interaction among two types of tokens. To investigate such multimodal interaction during model inference, in this paper, we measure the contextualization among the hidden state vectors of tokens from different modalities. Our experiments uncover a four-phase inference dynamics of VLLMs against the depth of Transformer-based LMs, including (I) Alignment: In very early layers, contextualization emerges between modalities, suggesting a feature space alignment. (II) Intra-modal Encoding: In early layers, intra-modal contextualization is enhanced while inter-modal interaction is suppressed, suggesting a local encoding within modalities. (III) Inter-modal Encoding: In later layers, contextualization across modalities is enhanced, suggesting a deeper fusion across modalities. (IV) Output Preparation: In very late layers, contextualization is reduced globally, and hidden states are aligned towards the unembedding space.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LLM A*: Human in the Loop Large Language Models Enabled A* Search for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01797v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with (path) planning for mobile embodied agents such as robots, in a human-in-the-loop and interactive manner. A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks.

However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mosaic Memory of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15523v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely adopted, understanding how they learn from, and memorize, training data becomes crucial. Memorization in LLMs is widely assumed to only occur as a result of sequences being repeated in the training data. Instead, we show that LLMs memorize by assembling information from similar sequences, a phenomena we call mosaic memory. We show major LLMs to exhibit mosaic memory, with fuzzy duplicates contributing to memorization as much as 0.8 of an exact duplicate and even heavily modified sequences contributing substantially to memorization. Despite models display reasoning capabilities, we somewhat surprisingly show memorization to be predominantly syntactic rather than semantic. We finally show fuzzy duplicates to be ubiquitous in real-world data, untouched by deduplication techniques. Taken together, our results challenge widely held beliefs and show memorization to be a more complex, mosaic process, with real-world implications for privacy, confidentiality, model utility and evaluation.</p></details> |  |

While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model (LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling (SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii) position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks, including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation, single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,16 figures.This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

While a number of methods have been introduced for processing large three-dimensional images in order to generate secondary data, there are only a few techniques available for simple and intuitive visualization of such data in their entirety. This work employs the AccuStripes visualization technique for that purpose, which enables the visual analysis of secondary data represented by an ensemble of univariate distributions. It supports different schemes for adaptive histogram binnings in combination with several ways of rendering aggregated data and it allows the interactive selection of optimal visual representations depending on the data and the use case. We demonstrate the usability of AccuStripes on a high-resolution synchrotron scan of a particle-reinforced metal matrix composite sample, containing more than 20 million particles. Through AccuStripes, detailed insights are facilitated into distributions of derived particle characteristics of the entire sample. Furthermore, research questions such as how the overall shape of the particles is or how homogeneously they are distributed across the sample can be answered.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Re...</summary><p>in Review at Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation</p></details> |

In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to accommodate visual inputs with different resolutions, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features for better cross-modal alignment. After continual pre-training, leading VFMs like DINOv2, SigLIP and AIMv2 achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding tasks but also in generic classification and segmentation tasks. Remarkably, CoMP-AIMv2 achieves scores of 64.9 on ChartQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.3% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 51.8 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/SliMM-X/CoMP-MM</p></details> |
| **[Analog Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09663v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions, off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context. Here, we show that foundation models applied to physical systems can give accurate predictions, but that they fail to develop meaningful representations of the underlying physics. Instead, foundation models often forecast by context parroting, a simple zero-shot forecasting strategy that copies directly from the context. As a result, a naive direct context parroting model scores higher than state-of-the-art time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains why large language models trained on text can be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the attractor, providing insight into the previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. Context parroting thus serves as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline for future time-series foundation models and can help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</p></details> |  |

We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.</p></details> |  |

Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</p></details> |  |

Existing techniques tend to be specialized in individual scenarios and lack generalization capacities. In this study, our objective is to develop a generic anomaly detection model that can be applied in multiple scenarios. To achieve this, we custom-build generic visual language foundation models that possess extensive knowledge and robust reasoning abilities as anomaly detectors and reasoners. Specifically, we introduce a multi-modal prompting strategy that incorporates domain knowledge from experts as conditions to guide the models. Our approach considers diverse prompt types, including task descriptions, class context, normality rules, and reference images. In addition, we unify the input representation of multi-modality into a 2D image format, enabling multi-modal anomaly detection and reasoning. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that combining visual and language prompts as conditions for customizing the models enhances anomaly detection performance. The customized models showcase the ability to detect anomalies across different data modalities such as images, point clouds, and videos. Qualitative case studies further highlight the anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities, particularly for multi-object scenes and temporal data.

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations at www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop EVAL-FoMo-2</p></details> |

Recently, a brain-inspired SSL model named PhiNet was proposed; it is based on a ResNet backbone and operates on static image inputs with strong augmentation. In this paper, we introduce PhiNet v2, a novel Transformer-based architecture that processes temporal visual input (that is, sequences of images) without relying on strong augmentation. Our model leverages variational inference to learn robust visual representations from continuous input streams, similar to human visual processing. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PhiNet v2 achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision foundation models, while maintaining the ability to learn from sequential input without strong data augmentation. This work represents a significant step toward more biologically plausible computer vision systems that process visual information in a manner more closely aligned with human cognitive processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.14650</p></details> |

To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{GraphOracle}}, a relation-centric foundation model that unifies reasoning across knowledge graphs by converting them into Relation-Dependency Graphs (RDG), explicitly encoding compositional patterns with fewer edges than prior methods. A query-dependent attention mechanism is further developed to learn inductive representations for both relations and entities. Pre-training on diverse knowledge graphs, followed by minutes-level fine-tuning, enables effective generalization to unseen entities, relations, and entire graphs. Through comprehensive experiments on 31 diverse benchmarks spanning transductive, inductive, and cross-domain settings, we demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance with minimal adaptation, improving the prediction performance by up to 35\% compared to the strongest baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Redundancy-Aware Pretraining of Vision-Language Foundation Models in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11121v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique, importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Temporal Alignment for Auto-regressive PDE Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10930v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction, causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation models on diverse time-dependent PDE data.

Wearable sensing data, however, pose unique challenges due to their variability in patterns and frequency bands, especially for healthcare-related outcomes. The main obstacle lies in crafting generalizable representations that adapt efficiently across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. To address this, we propose NormWear, the first multi-modal and ubiquitous foundation model designed to extract generalized and informative representations from wearable sensing data. Specifically, we design a channel-aware attention mechanism with a shared special liaison [CLS] token to detect signal patterns in both intra-sensor and inter-sensors. This helps the model to extract more meaningful information considering both time series themselves and the relationships between input sensors. This helps the model to be widely compatible with various sensors settings. NormWear is pretrained on a diverse set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public datasets. Our model shows exceptional generalizability across 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in mental health, body state inference, vital sign estimation, and disease risk evaluation. It consistently outperforms competitive baselines under zero-shot, partial-shot, and full-shot settings, indicating broad applicability in real-world health applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at: http://github.com/Mobile-Sensing-and-UbiComp-Laboratory/NormWear</p></details> |

Due to the complexity of the instrumentation and resulting data, sophisticated computational methods are required for the processing and interpretation of acquired mass spectra. Machine learning has shown great promise to improve the analysis of mass spectrometry data, with numerous purpose-built methods for improving specific steps in the data acquisition and analysis pipeline reaching widespread adoption. Here, we propose unifying various spectrum prediction tasks under a single foundation model for mass spectra. To this end, we pre-train a spectrum encoder using de novo sequencing as a pre-training task. We then show that using these pre-trained spectrum representations improves our performance on the four downstream tasks of spectrum quality prediction, chimericity prediction, phosphorylation prediction, and glycosylation status prediction. Finally, we perform multi-task fine-tuning and find that this approach improves the performance on each task individually. Overall, our work demonstrates that a foundation model for tandem mass spectrometry proteomics trained on de novo sequencing learns generalizable representations of spectra, improves performance on downstream tasks where training data is limited, and can ultimately enhance data acquisition and analysis in proteomics experiments.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from both general-purpose and medical domain-specific foundation models for training lightweight adapter models in multi-class radiography classification, focusing specifically on tube placement assessment. A dataset comprising 8842 radiographs classified into seven distinct categories was employed to extract embeddings using six foundation models: DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, Med-Flamingo, MedImageInsight, Rad-DINO, and CXR-Foundation. Adapter models were subsequently trained using classical machine learning algorithms. Among these combinations, MedImageInsight embeddings paired with an support vector machine adapter yielded the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) at 93.8%, followed closely by Rad-DINO (91.1%) and CXR-Foundation (89.0%). In comparison, BiomedCLIP and DenseNet121 exhibited moderate performance with mAUC scores of 83.0% and 81.8%, respectively, whereas Med-Flamingo delivered the lowest performance at 75.1%. Notably, most adapter models demonstrated computational efficiency, achieving training within one minute and inference within seconds on CPU, underscoring their practicality for clinical applications. Furthermore, fairness analyses on adapters trained on MedImageInsight-derived embeddings indicated minimal disparities, with gender differences in performance within 2% and standard deviations across age groups not exceeding 3%. These findings confirm that foundation model embeddings-especially those from MedImageInsight-facilitate accurate, computationally efficient, and equitable diagnostic classification using lightweight adapters for radiographic image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16 climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial data analysis and used to support scientific research.</p></details> |  |

However, current models often require extra fine-tuning to apply their learned structural and semantic representations to new graphs, which limits their versatility. Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot inductive reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs), offer us a new perspective on extending KG reasoning to general graph applications. In this paper, we introduce SCR, a unified graph reasoning framework designed to train on knowledge graphs and effectively generalize across a wide range of graph tasks and domains. We begin by designing the task-specific KG structures to establish a unified topology for different task formats. Then we propose semantic-conditioned message passing, a novel mechanism addressing the inherent semantic isolation in traditional KG reasoning, by jointly modeling structural and semantic invariance patterns in graph representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate the inductive reasoning capability of SCR using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our results show substantial performance gains over existing foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p></details> | 25 Pages, 5 figures |

Traditional approaches require retraining models for each new system, limiting generalizability and efficiency. In this work, we take a step toward foundation models for chemical reactor modeling by introducing a neural network framework that generalizes across diverse reactor types and rapidly adapts to new chemical processes. Our approach leverages meta-learning to pretrain the model on a broad set of reactor dynamics, enabling efficient adaptation to unseen reactions with minimal data. To further enhance generalizability, we incorporate physics-informed fine-tuning, ensuring physically consistent adaptation to new reactor conditions. Our framework is evaluated across three integer-order fundamental reactor types - continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors - demonstrating superior few-shot adaptation compared to conventional data-driven, physics-informed, and transfer learning approaches. By combining meta-learning with physics-informed adaptation, this work lays the foundation for a generalizable modeling framework, advancing the development of foundation models for chemical engineering applications.

On the other hand, multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) enables more precise cell type identification via proteomic markers, but has yet to achieve widespread clinical adoption due to cost and logistical constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI (Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid), epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of 0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20, substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safe Robot Foundation Models Using Inductive Biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10219v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is a critical requirement for the real-world deployment of robotic systems. Unfortunately, while current robot foundation models show promising generalization capabilities across a wide variety of tasks, they fail to address safety, an important aspect for ensuring long-term operation. Current robot foundation models assume that safe behavior should emerge by learning from a sufficiently large dataset of demonstrations. However, this approach has two clear major drawbacks. Firstly, there are no formal safety guarantees for a behavior cloning policy trained using supervised learning. Secondly, without explicit knowledge of any safety constraints, the policy may require an unreasonable number of additional demonstrations to even approximate the desired constrained behavior. To solve these key issues, we show how we can instead combine robot foundation models with geometric inductive biases using ATACOM, a safety layer placed after the foundation policy that ensures safe state transitions by enforcing action constraints. With this approach, we can ensure formal safety guarantees for generalist policies without providing extensive demonstrations of safe behavior, and without requiring any specific fine-tuning for safety. Our experiments show that our approach can be beneficial both for classical manipulation tasks, where we avoid unwanted collisions with irrelevant objects, and for dynamic tasks, such as the robot air hockey environment, where we can generate fast trajectories respecting complex tasks and joint space constraints.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model (LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling (SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii) position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks, including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation, single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,16 figures.This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively. Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM, ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a 22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.</p></details> |  |

While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed.

While deep learning has greatly advanced segmentation in clinical settings, there is limited work on pre-clinical imaging, notably in porcine models, which are often used due to their anatomical and physiological similarity to humans. However, differences between species create a domain shift that complicates direct model transfer from human to pig data. Recently, foundation models trained on large human datasets have shown promise for robust medical image segmentation; yet their applicability to porcine data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models can generate sufficiently accurate pseudo-labels for pig cardiac CT and propose a simple self-training approach to iteratively refine these labels. Our method requires no manually annotated pig data, relying instead on iterative updates to improve segmentation quality. We demonstrate that this self-training process not only enhances segmentation accuracy but also smooths out temporal inconsistencies across consecutive frames. Although our results are encouraging, there remains room for improvement, for example by incorporating more sophisticated self-training strategies and by exploring additional foundation models and other cardiac imaging technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at FIMH 2025</p></details> |

However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain, handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing several promising directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics 2025</p></details> |

Despite extensive studies on scaling behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Although foundation models (FMs) have recently demonstrated impressive generalizability and transfer learning capabilities by leveraging vast and diverse datasets, their performance can be undermined by spurious correlations that arise from variations in image quality, labeling uncertainty, and sensitive patient attributes. In this work, we explore the fairness and bias of FMs for breast mammography classification by leveraging a large pool of datasets from diverse sources-including data from underrepresented regions and an in-house dataset. Our extensive experiments show that while modality-specific pre-training of FMs enhances performance, classifiers trained on features from individual datasets fail to generalize across domains. Aggregating datasets improves overall performance, yet does not fully mitigate biases, leading to significant disparities across under-represented subgroups such as extreme breast densities and age groups. Furthermore, while domain-adaptation strategies can reduce these disparities, they often incur a performance trade-off. In contrast, fairness-aware techniques yield more stable and equitable performance across subgroups. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating rigorous fairness evaluations and mitigation strategies into FM-based models to foster inclusive and generalizable AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, a detailed understanding of the forest floor remains a challenge due to high natural variability, quickly changing environmental parameters, and ambiguous annotations due to unclear definitions. To address this issue, we adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model with strong generalization capabilities, to segment forest floor objects such as tree stumps, vegetation, and woody debris. To this end, we employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to fine-tune a small subset of additional model parameters while keeping the original weights fixed. We adjust SAM's mask decoder to generate masks corresponding to our dataset categories, allowing for automatic segmentation without manual prompting. Our results show that the adapter-based PEFT method achieves the highest mean intersection over union (mIoU), while Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA), with fewer parameters, offers a lightweight alternative for resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Novel Approaches for Precision Agriculture and Forestry with Autonomous Robots IEEE ICRA Workshop - 2025</p></details> |
| **[Probability Consistency in Large Language Models: Theoretical Foundations Meet Empirical Discrepancies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08739v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward, or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely) agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs' probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.</p></details> |  |

To address limitations in existing next-token prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to leverage fine-tuning.</p></details> | 19 pages; 14 figures |
| **[TiMo: Spatiotemporal Foundation Model for Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08723v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) provide continuous observations of the Earth's surface, making them essential for applications such as environmental management and disaster assessment. However, existing spatiotemporal foundation models rely on plain vision transformers, which encode entire temporal sequences without explicitly capturing multiscale spatiotemporal relationships between land objects. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose TiMo, a novel hierarchical vision transformer foundation model tailored for SITS analysis. At its core, we introduce a spatiotemporal gyroscope attention mechanism that dynamically captures evolving multiscale patterns across both time and space. For pre-training, we curate MillionST, a large-scale dataset of one million images from 100,000 geographic locations, each captured across 10 temporal phases over five years, encompassing diverse geospatial changes and seasonal variations. Leveraging this dataset, we adapt masked image modeling to pre-train TiMo, enabling it to effectively learn and encode generalizable spatiotemporal representations.Extensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal tasks-including deforestation monitoring, land cover segmentation, crop type classification, and flood detection-demonstrate TiMo's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Code, model, and dataset will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/TiMo.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent heterogenity of cancer and high cost of data generation make accurate prediction challenging. In this study, we investigate whether incorporating the pretrained foundation model scGPT can enhance the performance of existing drug response prediction frameworks. Our approach builds on the DeepCDR framework, which encodes drug representations from graph structures and cell representations from multi-omics profiles. We adapt this framework by leveraging scGPT to generate enriched cell representations using its pretrained knowledge to compensate for limited amount of data. We evaluate our modified framework using IC$_{50}$ values on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and a leave-one-drug out validation strategy, comparing it against the original DeepCDR framework and a prior scFoundation-based approach. scGPT not only outperforms previous approaches but also exhibits greater training stability, highlighting the value of leveraging scGPT-derived knowledge in this domain.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

This study explores the application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models, trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology samples.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in machine learning (ML), especially with foundation models (FMs) trained on extensive datasets, excel in extracting features and show promise in disaster management. Nevertheless, these models often inherit biases from training data, challenging their performance over extreme values. To explore the reliability of FM in the context of extreme events, we introduce \textbf{ExE}Bench (\textbf{Ex}treme \textbf{E}arth Benchmark), a collection of seven extreme event categories across floods, wildfires, storms, tropical cyclones, extreme precipitation, heatwaves, and cold waves. The dataset features global coverage, varying data volumes, and diverse data sources with different spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics. To broaden the real-world impact of FMs, we include multiple challenging ML tasks that are closely aligned with operational needs in extreme events detection, monitoring, and forecasting. ExEBench aims to (1) assess FM generalizability across diverse, high-impact tasks and domains, (2) promote the development of novel ML methods that benefit disaster management, and (3) offer a platform for analyzing the interactions and cascading effects of extreme events to advance our understanding of Earth system, especially under the climate change expected in the decades to come.

We present Meta-EyeFM, a multi-function foundation model that integrates a large language model (LLM) with vision foundation models (VFMs) for ocular disease assessment. Meta-EyeFM leverages a routing mechanism to enable accurate task-specific analysis based on text queries. Using Low Rank Adaptation, we fine-tuned our VFMs to detect ocular and systemic diseases, differentiate ocular disease severity, and identify common ocular signs. The model achieved 100% accuracy in routing fundus images to appropriate VFMs, which achieved $\ge$ 82.2% accuracy in disease detection, $\ge$ 89% in severity differentiation, $\ge$ 76% in sign identification. Meta-EyeFM was 11% to 43% more accurate than Gemini-1.5-flash and ChatGPT-4o LMMs in detecting various eye diseases and comparable to an ophthalmologist. This system offers enhanced usability and diagnostic performance, making it a valuable decision support tool for primary eye care or an online LLM for fundus evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08319v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck in multi-agent AI is the lack of simulateable models for the bottom-up emergence of social structure under realistic behavioral constraints. Similarly, many foundational theories in economics and sociology including the concepts of "institutions" and "norms" tend to describe social structures post hoc, often relying on implicit assumptions of shared culture, morality, or symbolic agreement. These concepts are often treated as primitives rather than reconstructed from agent-level behavior, leaving both their origins and operational definitions under-specified. To address this, we propose a three-stage bottom-up framework: Reciprocal Dynamics, capturing individual-level reciprocal exchanges; Norm Stabilization, the consolidation of shared expectations; and Institutional Construction, the externalization of stable patterns into scalable structures. By grounding social emergence in agent-level reciprocity, our framework enables the systematic exploration of how moral, cultural, and institutional structures emerge from cognitively minimal interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First draft extending the first position paper.

However, optimizing SFMs for SIP-HI has been insufficiently explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to identify key design factors affecting SIP-HI performance with 5 SFMs, focusing on encoder layer selection, prediction head architecture, and ensemble configurations. Our findings show that, contrary to traditional use-all-layers methods, selecting a single encoder layer yields better results. Additionally, temporal modeling is crucial for effective prediction heads. We also demonstrate that ensembling multiple SFMs improves performance, with stronger individual models providing greater benefit. Finally, we explore the relationship between key SFM attributes and their impact on SIP-HI performance. Our study offers practical insights into effectively adapting SFMs for speech intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Foundation Model Embedding-Based Semantic Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07998v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic anomalies are contextually invalid or unusual combinations of familiar visual elements that can cause undefined behavior and failures in system-level reasoning for autonomous systems. This work explores semantic anomaly detection by leveraging the semantic priors of state-of-the-art vision foundation models, operating directly on the image. We propose a framework that compares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal scenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this work, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw grid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for object-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly localization. These results highlight the potential utility of vision embeddings from foundation models for real-time anomaly detection in autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the Workshop "Safely Leveraging Vision-Language Foundation Models in Robotics: Challenges and Opportunities" at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

The framework is explicitly capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm under formally bounded risk. Building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation, EG-MRSI introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success. This signal regulates both a metacognitive mapping and a self-modification operator constrained by provable safety mechanisms. We formally define the initial agent configuration, emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions, and derive a reinforcement-compatible optimization objective that guides the agent's development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are introduced as quantifiable metrics of semantic learning, closing the gap between internal structure and predictive informativeness. This Part I paper establishes the single-agent theoretical foundations of EG-MRSI. Future parts will extend this framework to include safety certificates and rollback protocols (Part II), collective intelligence mechanisms (Part III), and feasibility constraints including thermodynamic and computational limits (Part IV).

Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the SP 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |

These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model \cite{Baqu2019SethiR}. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE \cite{empriseem_ai_images}. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Leaf Disease Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07019v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture. However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications.

However, their large-scale nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs, enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees. Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.</p></details> | On going work |
| **[Long Term Memory: The Foundation of AI Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15665v4)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

Yet climate variability, habitat loss, and data limitations in remote ecosystems that lack basic infrastructure support pose significant challenges to effective fisheries management. This project explores the integration of multimodal foundation AI and expert-in-the-loop frameworks to enhance wild salmon monitoring and sustainable fisheries management in Indigenous rivers across Pacific Northwest.

Expert validation and active learning frameworks ensure ecological relevance while reducing annotation burdens. To address unique technical and societal challenges, we bring together a cross-domain, interdisciplinary team of university researchers, fisheries biologists, Indigenous stewardship practitioners, government agencies, and conservation organizations.

Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness.

| **[Improving Generalization of Medical Image Registration Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06527v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing, aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures, varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations, this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical image registration technology.

| **[Adapting a Segmentation Foundation Model for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06217v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have shown strong performance in various vision tasks, particularly image segmentation, due to their impressive zero-shot segmentation capabilities. However, effectively adapting such models for medical image classification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize the SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based features that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image, while freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next, we propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to compute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The features extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to compute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning classification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or meaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance. Experimental results on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, current transfer learning strategies devoted to full fine-tuning for transfer learning may require significant resources and yield sub-optimal results when the labeled data of the target task is scarce. This makes its applicability in real clinical settings challenging since these institutions are usually constrained on data and computational resources to develop proprietary solutions. To address this challenge, we formalize Few-Shot Efficient Fine-Tuning (FSEFT), a novel and realistic scenario for adapting medical image segmentation foundation models. This setting considers the key role of both data- and parameter-efficiency during adaptation. Building on a foundation model pre-trained on open-access CT organ segmentation sources, we propose leveraging Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and black-box Adapters to address such challenges. Furthermore, novel efficient adaptation methodologies are introduced in this work, which include Spatial black-box Adapters that are more appropriate for dense prediction tasks and constrained transductive inference, leveraging task-specific prior knowledge. Our comprehensive transfer learning experiments confirm the suitability of foundation models in medical image segmentation and unveil the limitations of popular fine-tuning strategies in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Medical Image Analysis.

While foundation models have been useful in natural language processing and some vision tasks for some time, the foundation model developed with image segmentation in mind - Segment Anything Model (SAM) - has been developed only recently and has shown similar promise. However, there are still no systematic analyses or "best-practice" guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of SAM for medical image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning algorithms across 18 combinations, and evaluates them on 17 datasets covering all common radiology modalities. Our study reveals that (1) fine-tuning SAM leads to slightly better performance than previous segmentation methods, (2) fine-tuning strategies that use parameter-efficient learning in both the encoder and decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture has a small impact on final performance, (4) further training SAM with self-supervised learning can improve final model performance. We also demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some methods popular in the literature and further expand our experiments into few-shot and prompt-based settings. Lastly, we released our code and MRI-specific fine-tuned weights, which consistently obtained superior performance over the original SAM, at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA)</p></details> |

Despite its importance, traditional seismic processing techniques face challenges such as noisy and damaged data and the reliance on manual, time-consuming workflows. The emergence of deep learning approaches has introduced effective and user-friendly alternatives, yet many of these deep learning approaches rely on synthetic datasets and specialized neural networks. Recently, foundation models have gained traction in the seismic domain, due to their success in the natural image domain. Therefore, we investigate the application of natural image foundation models on the three seismic processing tasks: demultiple, interpolation, and denoising. We evaluate the impact of different model characteristics, such as pre-training technique and neural network architecture, on performance and efficiency. Rather than proposing a single seismic foundation model, we critically examine various natural image foundation models and suggest some promising candidates for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission to Geophysics</p></details> |

Single cell profiling offers insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet the application of large-scale foundation models for predicting drug response in single cell data remains underexplored. To address this, we developed scDrugMap, an integrated framework featuring both a Python command-line interface and a web server for drug response prediction. scDrugMap evaluates a wide range of foundation models, including eight single-cell models and two large language models, using a curated dataset of over 326,000 cells in the primary collection and 18,800 cells in the validation set, spanning 36 datasets and diverse tissue and cancer types. We benchmarked model performance under pooled-data and cross-data evaluation settings, employing both layer freezing and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning strategies. In the pooled-data scenario, scFoundation achieved the best performance, with mean F1 scores of 0.971 (layer freezing) and 0.947 (fine-tuning), outperforming the lowest-performing model by over 50%. In the cross-data setting, UCE excelled post fine-tuning (mean F1: 0.774), while scGPT led in zero-shot learning (mean F1: 0.858). Overall, scDrugMap provides the first large-scale benchmark of foundation models for drug response prediction in single-cell data and serves as a user-friendly, flexible platform for advancing drug discovery and translational research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

We present PyTDC, an open-source machine-learning platform providing streamlined training, evaluation, and inference software for multimodal biological AI models. PyTDC unifies distributed, heterogeneous, continuously updated data sources and model weights and standardizes benchmarking and inference endpoints. This paper discusses the components of PyTDC's architecture and, to our knowledge, the first-of-its-kind case study on the introduced single-cell drug-target nomination ML task. We find state-of-the-art methods in graph representation learning and domain-specific methods from graph theory perform poorly on this task. Though we find a context-aware geometric deep learning method that outperforms the evaluated SoTA and domain-specific baseline methods, the model is unable to generalize to unseen cell types or incorporate additional modalities, highlighting PyTDC's capacity to facilitate an exciting avenue of research developing multimodal, context-aware, foundation models for open problems in biomedical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada.

Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Our analysis presents the following insights: i) Compared to LTSSL algorithms trained from scratch, FFT results in a decline in model performance, whereas LP and LFT, although boosting overall model performance, exhibit negligible benefits to tail classes. ii) LP produces numerous false pseudo-labels due to \textit{underlearned} training data, while LFT can reduce the number of these false labels but becomes overconfident about them owing to \textit{biased fitting} training data. This exacerbates the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases inherent in LTSSL, limiting performance improvement in the tail classes. With these insights, we propose a Unbiased Lightweight Fine-tuning strategy, \textbf{ULFine}, which mitigates the overconfidence via confidence-aware adaptive fitting of textual prototypes and counteracts the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases via complementary fusion of dual logits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULFine markedly decreases training costs by over ten times and substantially increases prediction accuracies compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Theoretical Foundations for Semantic Cognition in Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21218v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.</p></details> | <details><summary>248 p...</summary><p>248 pages, 77 figures</p></details> |

Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.</p></details> |  |

However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks.

These issues are especially critical in medical imaging. To address these limitations, we propose an Organ-Wise Tokenization (OWT) framework with a Token Group-based Reconstruction (TGR) training paradigm. Unlike conventional approaches that produce holistic features, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups, each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while allowing fine-grained control in downstream tasks. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OWT in not only achieving strong image reconstruction and segmentation performance, but also enabling novel semantic-level generation and retrieval applications that are out of reach for standard holistic embedding methods. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad scalability and applicability to real-world medical imaging scenarios and beyond.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and 92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98 to 0.99 against observation data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALFEE: Adaptive Large Foundation Model for EEG Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06291v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining, extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.</p></details> | 17pages, 17 figures |

An attempt is made to provide an introduction to some of the key concepts, their formal definitions and their interrelationships. These include the notion of a changing social world of multiple agents. The logic of social intelligence goes beyond classical logic by linking information with strategic thought. A minimal architecture of social agents is presented. The agents have different dynamically changing, possible choices and abilities. The agents also have uncertainty, lacking perfect information about their physical state as well as their dynamic social state. The social state of an agent includes the intentional state of that agent, as well as, that agent's representation of the intentional states of other agents. Furthermore, it includes the evaluations agents make of their physical and social condition. Communication, semantic and pragmatic meaning and their relationship to intention and information states are investigated. The logic of agent abilities and intentions are motivated and formalized. The entropy of group strategic states is defined.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p></details> |  |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TKDE; full version (27 pages, 9 figures)</p></details> |

Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are characterized by significantly larger scales (e.g., billions or trillions of parameters) compared to typical artificial intelligence (AI) models. LAMs exhibit outstanding cognitive abilities, including strong generalization capabilities for fine-tuning to downstream tasks, and emergent capabilities to handle tasks unseen during training. Therefore, LAMs efficiently provide AI services for diverse communication applications, making them crucial tools for addressing complex challenges in future wireless communication systems. This study provides a comprehensive review of the foundations, applications, and challenges of LAMs in communication. First, we introduce the current state of AI-based communication systems, emphasizing the motivation behind integrating LAMs into communications and summarizing the key contributions. We then present an overview of the essential concepts of LAMs in communication. This includes an introduction to the main architectures of LAMs, such as transformer, diffusion models, and mamba. We also explore the classification of LAMs, including large language models (LLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), and world models, and examine their potential applications in communication. Additionally, we cover the training methods and evaluation techniques for LAMs in communication systems. Lastly, we introduce optimization strategies such as chain of thought (CoT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and agentic systems. Following this, we discuss the research advancements of LAMs across various communication scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges in the current research and provide insights into potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |

In the field of Earth observation, over 75 remote sensing vision foundation models have been developed in the past four years. However, none has consistently outperformed the others across all available downstream tasks. To facilitate their comparison, we propose a cost-effective method for predicting a model's performance on multiple downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning on each one. This method is based on what we call "capabilities encoding." The utility of this novel approach is twofold: we demonstrate its potential to simplify the selection of a foundation model for a given new task, and we employ it to offer a fresh perspective on the existing literature, suggesting avenues for future research.

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

Many foundational concepts in economics and ethics such as "trust" or "morality" are often defined informally, without operational criteria or cognitive grounding, which limits their testability and implementation in artificial agents. Drawing on converging empirical evidence from primate behavior, infant cognition, and economic anthropology, we propose a conceptual framework composed of three cognitively minimal mechanisms: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost return sensitivity. This framework reframes trust as a graded cognitive expectation, providing a simulateable basis for reciprocal exchange in artificial agents, and enabling the bottom-up emergence of scalable cooperation and institutional dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a position paper.

Existing methods face limitations related to segmentation quality, scalability, and the range of applicable imaging modalities. In this paper, we uncover the potential of the internal representations within frozen medical foundation diffusion models as highly efficient zero-shot learners for tumor segmentation by introducing a novel framework named DiffuGTS. DiffuGTS creates anomaly-aware open-vocabulary attention maps based on text prompts to enable generalizable anomaly segmentation without being restricted by a predefined training category list. To further improve and refine anomaly segmentation masks, DiffuGTS leverages the diffusion model, transforming pathological regions into high-quality pseudo-healthy counterparts through latent space inpainting, and applies a novel pixel-level and feature-level residual learning approach, resulting in segmentation masks with significantly enhanced quality and generalization. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and seven tumor categories demonstrate the superior performance of our method, surpassing current state-of-the-art models across multiple zero-shot settings.

Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Website: https://voila.maitrix.org</p></details> |

Sparse-view reconstruction reduces radiation by using fewer X-ray projections while maintaining image quality, yet existing methods face challenges such as high computational demands and poor generalizability to different datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose DeepSparse, the first foundation model for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction, featuring DiCE (Dual-Dimensional Cross-Scale Embedding), a novel network that integrates multi-view 2D features and multi-scale 3D features. Additionally, we introduce the HyViP (Hybrid View Sampling Pretraining) framework, which pretrains the model on large datasets with both sparse-view and dense-view projections, and a two-step finetuning strategy to adapt and refine the model for new datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our proposed DeepSparse achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, paving the way for safer and more efficient CBCT imaging.</p></details> |  |

We present a mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training.

| **[Impact of Noisy Supervision in Foundation Model Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06869v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, preprint. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.17002</p></details> |
| **[On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'24 Main</p></details> |

Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Feature Upsampling Methods for Vision Foundation Models using Interactive Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02075v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs' popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context. One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly improves VFM features quality.

On the one hand, FL, as a collaborative learning paradigm, help address challenges in FM development by expanding data availability, enabling computation sharing, facilitating the collaborative development of FMs, tackling continuous data update, avoiding FM monopoly, response delay and FM service down. On the other hand, FM, equipped with pre-trained knowledge and exceptional performance, can serve as a robust starting point for FL. It can also generate synthetic data to enrich data diversity and enhance overall performance of FL. Meanwhile, FM unlocks new sharing paradigm and multi-task and multi-modality capabilities for FL. By examining the interplay between FL and FM, this paper presents the motivations, challenges, and future directions of empowering FL with FM and empowering FM with FL. We hope that this work provides a good foundation to inspire future research efforts to drive advancements in both fields.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples.

Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities-including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos-and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 73 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.</p></details> |  |
