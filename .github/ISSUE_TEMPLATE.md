This preprint develops a deterministic functional-topological framework showing that physical systems generate compact perceptual manifolds with finite radius. We provide theory, Monte-Carlo estimators, and validation across PM, battery, and ECG domains, unifying biological perception and self-supervised AI</p></details> |
